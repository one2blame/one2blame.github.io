7. SameSite Lax bypass via method override</a>

This vulnerable web application provides us with a cookie, but doesn't specify
the SameSite restriction. We can discover this after logging in via the /login
page. By default, if a website doesn't specify the SameSite restriction, the
browser will treat it as Lax. This leaves the user and website vulnerable to
CSRF attacks using GET requests.

Attempting to make a GET request against the /my-account/change-email endpoint
will fail due to the SameSite=Lax restriction. However, we can bypass this
restriction by providing a alternative \_method override parameter, setting the
\_method to POST. This will allow us to successfully change the email address of
the currently logged in user.

Solution:

```html
<script>
  document.location =
    "https://<LAB-ID>.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=pwned%40evil-user.net&_method=POST"
</script>
```
