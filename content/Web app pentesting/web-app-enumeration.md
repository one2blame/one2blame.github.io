## Discovering running services

After using [reconnaissance](web-app-recon.md) to define our web application
target's presence on the internet, we aim to enumerate the target's services. A
good example is simple simple
[banner grabbing](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/banner_grabbing).

## Manual HTTP endpoint discovery

In this context, HTTP endpoints are pages that we can request from the target
web application. We're interested in
[forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) - ways
we can provide input to the web application. A common tool used to interact with
web application targets is [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp). Endpoints
of interest can commonly be found in a
[robots.txt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Robots.txt) file
or an
[XML sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap#xml).

## Automated HTTP endpoint discovery

Manual HTTP endpoint discovery can be tedious, maybe time consuming, often
fruitless. Here are some tools / methods that can automatically crawl and
discover HTTP endpoints of a web application target:

- [Hakrawler](https://github.com/hakluke/hakrawler)
- [Dirbuster](https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/)

## Information disclosure

Occasionally, we'll run into web application targets that leak information via
errors or bad input due to poor design. We can go about discovering these edge
cases by [fuzzing](https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing) a web application,
and some useful tools for fuzzing are:

- [Wfuzz](https://www.edge-security.com/wfuzz.php)

Fuzzing isn't the _best_ way to go about finding information - it's likely
you'll be throttled, shadow banned, etc. for fuzzing a web application target.
In addition, it's likely the security team for the web app will be alerted to
your attack.

## Components with vulnerabilities

When targeting web applications, we'll find that some use JavaScript frameworks
like React, Angular, and jQuery. These frameworks can contain reported
vulnerabilities, and we can use automated tools like
[Retire.js](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/) to find them.
