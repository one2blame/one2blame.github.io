## HttpOnly

**HttpOnly** is a cookie directive provided by the server to a client (browser)
when issuing a cookie. This directive prevents JavaScript executing within the
browser from accessing the cookie - or at least through regular browser APIs, a
script will be unable to read the cookie.

This mitigation prevents things like an attacker hijacking a user's session
using XSS to expose the cookie value and exfiltrate it. More on this mitigation
is provided by OWASP:

## Content security policy (CSP)

**CSP** is a header response provided by the server to a client (browser). CSP
policies enable website administrators to direct to clients what content
sources they should trust, and where they should get their content from. For
example, if the server provides some HTML that attempts to load images, or
other media from an external source, those external sources should be listed in
the CSP or provided by the server itself.

This mitigation prevents things like an attacker injecting HTML to load frames
with malicious content from a different server that's untrusted by the original
server. More on this mitigation is provided by Mozilla:
