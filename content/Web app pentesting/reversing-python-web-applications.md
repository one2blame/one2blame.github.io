## Debugging Python web applications

Usually, Python web applications aren't distributed in some sort of "compiled" release format - but
they can be. We'll discuss reverse engineering compiled Python applications if we need to, but for
now we'll just talk about about plaintext web applications.

The best way to debug Python web applications is to use an IDE like VSCode or PyCharm. With VSCode,
we can remotely debug target applications using the [`ptvsd`](https://github.com/microsoft/ptvsd)
Python package. Insert the following magic words before a Python web application starts to enable
remote debugging:

```python
import ptvsd
ptvsd.enable_attach(redirect_output=True)
print("Now ready for the IDE to connect to the debugger")
ptvsd.wait_for_attach()
```

By default, `ptvsd` listens on port `5678` for a connection from the VSCode remote debugger. To
initiate remote debugging, connecting to our target web application with VSCode, we can use the
following `launch.json` specification:

```python
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python Debugger: Remote Attach",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "attach",
            "connect": {
                "host": "{DEBUG_TARGET_IP_ADDRESS}",
                "port": 5678
            },
            "pathMappings": [
                {
                    "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
                    "remoteRoot": "{PATH_TO_SOURCE_CODE}"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

`DEBUG_TARGET_IP_ADDRESS` is the IP address of the host running the Python web application.
`PATH_TO_SOURCE_CODE` is the path to the Python web application source code we're debugging in
VSCode.

That's it! It should "just work" - if not you can always read the documentation to debug.
