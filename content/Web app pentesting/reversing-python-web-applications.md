## Debugging Python web applications

Usually, Python web applications aren't distributed in some sort of "compiled"
release format - but they can be. We'll discuss reverse engineering compiled
Python applications if we need to, but for now we'll just talk about about
plaintext web applications.

The best way to debug Python web applications is to use an IDE like VSCode or
PyCharm. With VSCode, we can remotely debug target applications using the
[`ptvsd`](https://github.com/microsoft/ptvsd) Python package. Insert the
following magic words before a Python web application starts to enable remote
debugging:

```python
import ptvsd
ptvsd.enable_attach(redirect_output=True)
print("Now ready for the IDE to connect to the debugger")
ptvsd.wait_for_attach()
```

By default, `ptvsd` listens on port `5678` for a connection from the VSCode
remote debugger. To initiate remote debugging, connecting to our target web
application with VSCode, we can use the following `launch.json` specification:

```python
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python Debugger: Remote Attach",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "attach",
            "connect": {
                "host": "{DEBUG_TARGET_IP_ADDRESS}",
                "port": 5678
            },
            "pathMappings": [
                {
                    "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
                    "remoteRoot": "{PATH_TO_SOURCE_CODE}"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

`DEBUG_TARGET_IP_ADDRESS` is the IP address of the host running the Python web
application. `PATH_TO_SOURCE_CODE` is the path to the Python web application
source code we're debugging in VSCode.

That's it! It should "just work" - if not you can always read the documentation
to debug.
