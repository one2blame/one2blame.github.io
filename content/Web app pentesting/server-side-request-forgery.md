**Server-side request forgery (SSRF)** is a scenario in which the attacker can coerce the vulnerable
server to make requests to other hosts on the attacker's behalf. For instance, the server implements
an API that translates to the server forwarding the request to a different microservice. The
attacker is able to provide arbitrary input for the forwarded request, allowing the attacker access
to data they otherwise wouldn't be able to acquire. The server is behaving as a proxy between the
attacker and services the server has authorization to access.

## Interacting with backend services

Without prior knowledge of the network topography for a distributed system, attackers will have a
tough time using SSRF to proxy requests through a vulnerable web server. There are some known
targets of interest for cloud-oriented architectures, however. For instance, Amazon Web Services
(AWS) provides virtual machines with the ability to query against a metadata service at
169.254.169.254, and the same goes for virtual machines in other cloud providers like Azure. More on
this below:

## Testing multiple protocols

With an SSRF vulnerability, it's worth attempting to try different protocols for web requests to
backend targets, e.g.:

```bash
curl file:///etc/passwd
```

Executed on a host vulnerable to SSRF, if the web application reveals the response, we can read
arbitrary files from the web application's host.

### Gopher

**Gopher** is a protocol still supported by agents like `curl`, and we can use `gopher` to craft
HTTP requests with different methods, allowing us to send HTTP request methods to backend targets
other than the methods allowed by the vulnerable web application, e.g. `GET`.

- [Gopher](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)>)

For example, if we can provide an arbitrary URL to a web application vulnerable to SSRF, we can
provide a **gopher** URL, providing the method and headers we want to specify for the request:

```bash
curl gopher://127.0.0.1:80/_POST%20/status%20HTTP/1.1%0a%0a
```

And we can use characters like `%0a` to create newlines as necessary for our headers in the request.
