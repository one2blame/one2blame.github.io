## Sourcing wordlists

When attacking web applications, often we'll probably need to try and fuzz /
brute-force usernames and passwords. Common wordlists that are used throughout
the community are:

- [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
- [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)

## Creating custom wordlists

It's possible for us to create our own wordlists using source material from the
web application. [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) is an application
that will generate wordlists from a URL, crawling through all the endpoints to
gather words for the wordlist.
