If we get our hands on the compiled byte code for web technologies like C# and
Java, we can use various tools to recover the original source code that convert
the application's byte code to an intermediate language representation.

## C\#

For C# applications, we can use the `dnSpy` or `ILSpy` decompilers and debuggers
for recovering a close representation of a C# application's original source
code:

- [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy)

## Java

For Java applications, we can use `JD-GUI` to decompile and review a close
representation of a Java application's original source code:

## Debugging tips

Debugging compiled .NET applications can be difficult due to optimizations taken
by the compiler. To remove these obstacles, we can update an assembly's
attributes for debugging by adding the following with `dnSpy`:

```txt
[assembly: Debuggable(DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.Default | DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.DisableOptimizations | DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.IgnoreSymbolStoreSequencePoints | DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.EnableEditAndContinue)]
```

After editing these assembly attributes in `dnSpy`, we can re-compile the target
application and continue with our debugging adventures.
