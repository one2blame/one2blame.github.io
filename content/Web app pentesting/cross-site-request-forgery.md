**Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)** is an attack that involves phishing a victim to visit a
malicious site. The malicious site proceeds to execute actions on the victim's behalf, commonly
involving the reuse of a victim's cookies or authenticated session with a target site to submit
forms, read privileged content, etc. The official definition for this attack is provided by OWASP:

- [Cross site request forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)

## SameSite cookies

A mitigation for CSRF attacks is to disable the browser's usage of cookies when making cross-site
requests. When a server offers a browser a cookie, it can set the
[SameSite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value)
attribute, setting it to `Lax`, `Strict`, or `None`. With `Lax`and `Strict`, it becomes difficult
for an attacker to coerce a victim's browser to provide a cookie for requests against a target site.

Here's a great tool to determine what browsers use the SameSite attribute:

## CSRF tokens

CSRF tokens are managed by the server, and usually embedded into the HTML of a document, hidden, and
tied to a form. The server expects the user to provide both the form content, and the CSRF token
when submitting a `POST` request. If a CSRF token is not provided, the server will reject the `POST`
request, regardless of its content.

This mitigation makes it difficult for attackers to submit `POST` requests on a victim's behalf,
even if they can coerce the victim's browser to submit a session cookie for authentication. Without
the contents of a CSRF token provided by the server, tied to the current session, attacker-generated
requests will be denied by the server. More on CSRF tokens below:

## Weak CORS policies

Keep an eye out for servers with weak CORS policies that will allow us to use an arbitrary origin to
initiate a request, possibly allowing us to also supply credentials (cookies) for that server. To
determine a target's CORS policy, we can quickly use `curl`:

```bash
curl -X "OPTIONS" -i -k https://<IP_ADDR>
```

A CORS policy with a wildcard (\*) like:

```bash
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

Would allow a client to provide any arbitrary `Origin` header and complete a cross-origin request,
allowing the browser to provide the content to a JavaScript script. Wildcard CORS policies don't
allow the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to be set to `true`, and these CORS policies
have to be handled by the server's application code. So, if an arbitrary `Origin` is provided by the
client, it's like the server will parrot the `Origin` provided and allow it to provide a credential.

Finally, there's the possibility the application code is bad, and doesn't parse our provided
`Origin` correctly. If we find a vulnerability in `Origin` processing by fuzzing the
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, it's possible we can discover a domain that is allowed that
wasn't originally intended. We could then purchase the domain and host our attacks from there.

A tool to scan targets for CORS misconfigurations can be found here (I haven't gotten to work, yet,
but maybe it'll work for you):
