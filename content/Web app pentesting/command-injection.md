**Command injection** is a vulnerability in which a web application receives user input which
eventually leads to the web application executing a `system` function call, executing commands on
the host machine to conduct operating system related actions. An attacker can use this to obtain
information about the host operating system, gain code execution, and ultimately a shell and active
session. More about command injection from OWASP:

- [OWASP - Command Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection)

## Input sanitization

Often developers will attempt to mitigate command injection vulnerabilities using input
sanitization. There are several ways to bypass this, examples being encoding with either `base64` or
`xxd`. Some examples are provided in the resources below:

## Blind injection

If responses from the host after executing a command are not returned to the attacker via the web
application, we can use methods like `sleep` to execute **blind injection** to determine if our
input is being processed by the host server.

## Shells

With reliable command injection, attackers can create reverse or bind shells on the target through
various means. Here are some great resources and snippets for reverse and bind shell payloads on web
applications vulnerable to command injection:
