We cover **directory traversal** attacks in this section, attempting to leak
sensitive information from a web application target by providing arbitrary file
paths into URL parameters, HTML forms, etc.

## Suggestive parameters

**Suggestive** parameters are just keywords we should be on the lookout for when
enumerating a web application. During `GET` requests, if the endpoint we're
targeting is something like:

```
GET /search/ HTTP/1.1
```

we might be able to provide arbitrary file paths and discover files on the host.
Another example would be data parameters provided for HTTP methods:

```
GET /site/victim/lookup?file=<FILE_PATH> HTTP/1.1.
```

where `file` is a parameter we can use to provide arbitrary paths.

## Fuzzing

Similar to what we covered [[web-app-enumeration#Information disclosure|here]],
we can fuzz suspected directory traversal vulnerabilities for valid files using
`wfuzz` and wordlists. An example usage looks like:

```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt -u "http://victim-site/files?path=../../../../../../../../../../FUZZ"
```

Where we're using the [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
wordlist, also discussed [[wordlists|here]], to fuzz the victim web application
for local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities. If we know the length of a bad
response from the web application vs. a good response, we can filter out bad
responses using the `--hh <length>` parameter for `wfuzz`.
