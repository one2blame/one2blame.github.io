**Server-side template injection (SSTI)** is a vulnerability where a server uses
an attacker's input to render a template but fails to sanitize the content
provided, enabling the attacker to inject scripts or other malicious artifacts,
enabling [[cross-site-scripting|XSS]] attacks or remote code execution (RCE)
once the template is rendered. Below is a good introduction to SSTI from OWASP:

- [Testing for Server Side Template Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/18-Testing_for_Server_Side_Template_Injection)

## Templating engine discovery

There are various templating engines for web technologies, some examples are:

| Templating engine | Language   | Server / client side |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Twig              | PHP        | Server side          |
| Freemarker        | Java       | Server side          |
| Pug / Jade        | JavaScript | Server side          |
| Jinja             | Python     | Server side          |
| Handlebars        | JavaScript | Both                 |
| Mustache          | Multiple   | Varies               |

Knowing what template engine we're targeting is pivotal to successful
exploitation. To discover the templating engine for a target we suspect is
vulnerable to SSTI, follow their documentation and attempt to use
engine-specific syntax to discover the target's templating engine.

## Code execution with Twig

Some features of Twig enable attackers to gain RCE on PHP servers using SSTI.
Using **filters** that take functions as arguments, we can provide `system` as a
function, and then our argument can be some `bash` command that will be executed
on the host via PHP. For example, we use the
[`reduce`](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/filters/reduce.html) filter to read
files on the host:

```twig
{{ [0]|reduce('system', 'cat /etc/passwd') }}
```

## Code execution with Freemarker

**Apache Freemarker** is a templating engine commonly paired with Java
applications. If an attacker can provide arbitrary input to a server rendering
**Apache Freemarker** templates, attackers can gain RCE, e.g.:

```Freemarker
${"freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()("cat /etc/passwd")}
```

## Code execution with Pug

**Pug** is a templating engine for JavaScript and NodeJS, enabling the rendering
of templates both on the client and server side. Pug is used to inject and
generate HTML tags and content. Attackers can gain RCE on a NodeJS server
rendering Pug templates by abusing the `client_process.spawnSync` method, e.g.:

```pug
- var require = global.process.mainModule.require
= exec = require('child_process').spawnSync('cat', ['/etc/passwd']).stdout
```

## Leaking sensitive information from Jinja

**Jinja** is a templating engine for Python, primarily used for server-side
rendering. Attackers can use template injection attacks to disclose sensitive
information about a web application's configuration, e.g.:

```Jinja
{{ config | pprint}}
```

The above Jinja template leaks the global Flask `config` value for the Jinja
templating engine, and pretty prints the contents using the `pprint` filter.
