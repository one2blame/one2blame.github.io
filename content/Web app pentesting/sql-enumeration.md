Web applications have to store user data so that, when you login, they can restore your session, settings, etc. Where else would they hold this information but a relational database like SQL? Using SQL, however, increases the attack surface for a web application, and allows us to do a bunch of nasty things once we can inject SQL queries and commands. This section will cover some common techniques to enumerate a target's SQL server, given we have the ability to inject commands and queries.

## Enumerating MySQL databases

The following enumeration techniques also apply to [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).

Get the version of the MySQL server:

```mysql
select version();
```

Get the current user:

```mysql
select current_user();
```

Get the databases in the MySQL server:

```mysql
show databases;
```

Get a list of all table schemas in the MySQL server:

```mysql
select table_schema from information_schema.tables group by table_schema;
```

Get a list of all tables with a certain table schema:

```mysql
select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'app';
```

Get a list of columns and their data types for a table:

```mysql
select column_name, data_type from information_schema.columns where table_schema = 'app' and table_name = 'menu';
```

## Enumerating Microsoft SQL Server databases

Get the version of the Microsoft SQL server:

```sql
select @@version;
```

Get the current user:

```sql
select SYSTEM_USER;
```

Get the databases in the Microsoft SQL server:

```sql
select name from sys.databases;
```

Get a list of all tables in a database in the Microsoft SQL server:

```sql
select * from app.information_schema.tables;
```

Get a list of columns and their data types for a table:

```sql
select COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE from app.information_schema.columns where TABLE_NAME = 'menu';
```

## Enumerating PostgreSQL databases

PostgreSQL is similar to MySQL, so we'll just cover some minor differences.

Get the current user:

```postgresql
select current_user();
```

Get the databases in the PostgreSQL server:

```postgresql
select datname from pg_database;
```

Get a list of all tables with a certain table schema:

```postgresql
select table_name from app.information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'public';
```

Get a list of columns and their data types for a table:

```postgresql
select column_name, data_type from app.information_schema.columns where table_name = 'menu';
```

## Enumerating Oracle databases

Get the version of the Oracle server:

```sql
select * from v$version
```

Get the current user:

```sql
select user from dual
```

Get a list of all schemas in the Oracle server:

```sql
select owner from all_tables group by owner
```

Get a list of all tables matching a schema in the Oracle server:

```sql
select table_name from all_tables where owner = 'SYS' order by table_name
```

Get a list of columns and their data types for a table:

```sql
select column_name, data_type from all_tab_columns where table_name = 'MENU'
```
