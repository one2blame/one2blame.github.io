## Useful configuration files

Java web applications map API routes to **Java servlets**, as described in our
[[source-code-analysis-methodology|Source code analysis methodology]] notes. The default location
Java web applications store their Java servlet mappings is:

- **web.xml** No guaranteed which folder this can typically be found in, but be on the lookout for
  this configuration file in a Java web application.

## Useful method names

Java servlets typically name functions that handle HTTP methods as such:

- doGet
- doPost
- doPut
- doDelete
- doCopy
- doOptions Java servlets handling HTTP requests usually operate on `HttpServletRequest` objects,
  and extracts `GET` or `POST` parameters using methods like:
- getParameter
- getParameterValues

## Enabling database logging

Relevant to web application pentesting in general, it's important to turn on database logging to
debug our interactions with a target's underlying database. This helps us determine how our queries
are executed on the host's database to uncover any possible input sanitization.
