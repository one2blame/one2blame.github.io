## Useful configuration files

Java web applications map API routes to **Java servlets**, as described in our
[[source-code-analysis-methodology|Source code analysis methodology]] notes. The
default location Java web applications store their Java servlet mappings is:

- **web.xml** No guaranteed which folder this can typically be found in, but be
  on the lookout for this configuration file in a Java web application.

## Useful method names

Java servlets typically name functions that handle HTTP methods as such:

- doGet
- doPost
- doPut
- doDelete
- doCopy
- doOptions Java servlets handling HTTP requests usually operate on
  `HttpServletRequest` objects, and extracts `GET` or `POST` parameters using
  methods like:
- getParameter
- getParameterValues

## Enabling database logging

Relevant to web application pentesting in general, it's important to turn on
database logging to debug our interactions with a target's underlying database.
This helps us determine how our queries are executed on the host's database to
uncover any possible input sanitization.
