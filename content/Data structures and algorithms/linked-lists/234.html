<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/">234. Palindrome Linked List</a>

A fun question with a long solution. Determine if a linked list is a palindrome, meaning that the
linked list is the same when read frontwards and backwards. We're asked to do this in place in O(1)
space.

So how do we solve this? Well using our usual techniques of finding the middle node, we'll create a
fast and slow node to find the middle. Then we'll use our other technique of list reversal to reverse
the second half of the list.

Iterating through the first half and the reversed second half, we'll compare the value of the nodes.
If the nodes are not equal, we return false. If we reach the end of the list, we return true.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
      def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
          prev = None
          curr = head

          while curr:
              next_node = curr.next
              curr.next = prev
              prev = curr
              curr = next_node

          return prev

      def findMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
          slow = head
          fast = head

          while fast.next and fast.next.next:
              fast = fast.next.next
              slow = slow.next

          return slow

      def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
          if not head:
              return True

          first_half_curr = head
          second_half_curr = self.reverseList(self.findMiddle(head).next)

          while second_half_curr:
              if first_half_curr.val != second_half_curr.val:
                  return False
              first_half_curr, second_half_curr = (
                  first_half_curr.next,
                  second_half_curr.next,
              )

          return True


_ Time Complexity:

  O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(1) - We maintain pointers that occupy constant space.
