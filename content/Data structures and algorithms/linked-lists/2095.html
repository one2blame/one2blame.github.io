2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List</a>

Given a linked list, remove the middle node. This one's pretty straightforward. Using a fast and slow
pointer, we traverse the list with the fast pointer until the slow pointer reaches the middle. We
also maintain the previous node, the node before the slow pointer.

Once we reach the middle, we point the previous node the the node after the slow pointer and return
the head.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
      def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
          prev, slow, fast = None, head, head.next

          while fast:
              fast = fast.next
              if fast:
                  fast = fast.next
              prev = slow
              slow = slow.next

          if not prev:
              return prev

          prev.next = slow.next
          return head


_ Time Complexity:

  O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(1) - We maintain pointers that occupy constant space.
