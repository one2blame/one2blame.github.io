<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/">278. First Bad
Version</a>

We're given an API called isBadVersion() -> bool, and we're asked to find the
first bad version from a range of n versions. Every version after the first bad
version, from versions[bad:n + 1] will return True. We use binary search and
decrease our search space to the left if the version isn't bad, and vice versa
if the version is bad. Eventually, our left pointer will be at the first bad
version.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
          l, r = 1, n

          while l <= r:
              m = (l + r) // 2

              if not isBadVersion(m):
                  l = m + 1
              else:
                  r = m - 1

          return l
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(logn) - Standard binary search time complexity.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We store a left and right pointer.
