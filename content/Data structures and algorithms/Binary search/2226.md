2226. Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children</a>

Another search space question. We're given piles of candies, candies[i], and k
children. We asked to find the maximum amount of candy we can give to each child
from the piles. Piles can't be mixed, however, they can be split.

Our search space will be 1, the smallest candy pile we can create, and
sum(candies) // k, the largest pile of candy we can give to a single child.
We'll use binary search to find the maximum amount of candy we can give to each
child. The key for search is sum(c // m for c in candies) < k - if we can't
create enough candy piles we decrease our search space by decreasing the size of
the piles, setting r = m. Otherwise, if our candy piles are small enough to give
to each child, we need to increase the size of our piles, setting l = m + 1.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def maximumCandies(self, candies: List[int], k: int) -> int:
          l, r = 1, sum(candies) // k

          while l <= r:
              m = (r + l) // 2

              if sum(c // m for c in candies) < k:
                  r = m - 1
              else:
                  l = m + 1

          return r
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(c log(n)) - Where c is the number of candy piles and n is the maximum number
of candies we can give to a child.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We use a constant amount of space.
