1283. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold</a>

We're asked to find the smallest divisor that we can divide all the numbers
provided in the nums list such that the sum of their quotients is less than or
equal to the threshold.

We use binary search to discover this threshold, with the rightmost limit being
the maximum number provided in the nums list. During each iteration, we
calculate the sum of the quotients with the current selected divisor.
Eventually, the leftmost limit of the search will be our answer.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from math import ceil

class Solution:
    def smallestDivisor(self, nums: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:
        l, r = 1, max(nums)

        while l <= r:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            t = sum([ceil(num / m) for num in nums])

            if t <= threshold:
                r = m - 1
            else:
                l = m + 1

        return l
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n log(k)) - Where k is the maximum number in the nums list, and n is the
length of the nums list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We use constant space to retain our variables.
