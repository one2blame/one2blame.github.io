<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/">704. Binary Search</a>

Standard binary search.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        while l <= r:
            m = (l + r) // 2

            if nums[m] == target:
                return m
            elif nums[m] < target:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m - 1

        return -1
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(log(n)) - Standard binary search time complexity.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - Binary search uses constant space.
