2517. Maximum Tastiness of Candy Basket</a>

We're given a list of prices, price[i], where price[i] is the price of the ith
candy. We're also given the desired size of a candy basket, k. We're asked to
find the maximum tastiness of a basket, where tastiness is a function of the
minimum absolute difference between the prices of any pair of candies in the
basket.

To solve this problem, we binary search through the prices of the candies
provided, from the minimum price to maximum difference of prices, max(price) -
min(price). During each step of the binary search, our decision function
involves constructing a basket of candies with the difference between the pairs
of candies being greater than or equal to the current mid value. If we can
construct a basket with k or more candies, we update our left pointer to
mid + 1. Otherwise, we update our right pointer to mid - 1. We continue this
process until our left pointer is greater than our right pointer. The maximum
tastiness of the basket is the value of the right pointer.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def maximumTastiness(self, price: List[int], k: int) -> int:
          price.sort()
          min_price = price[0]
          l, r, n = 0, price[-1] - min_price, len(price)

          while l <= r:
              m = (r + l) // 2

              prev, basket = min_price, 1

              for i in range(1, n):
                  if price[i] - prev >= m:
                      basket += 1
                      prev = price[i]

              if basket < k:
                  r = m - 1
              else:
                  l = m + 1

          return r
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n log(n) + n log(p)) - Where n is the number of prices and p is the maximum
difference of prices.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Python's sorting algorithm uses O(n) space.
