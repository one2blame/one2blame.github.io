<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/">35. Search
Insert Position</a>

Binary search question. Given a target value, find it in the array. If it's not
in the array, find the index where it should be inserted.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while l <= r:
            m = (r + l) // 2

            if nums[m] == target:
                return m

            if nums[m] < target:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m - 1

        return l
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(log(n)) - Binary search time complexity.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We use constant space.
