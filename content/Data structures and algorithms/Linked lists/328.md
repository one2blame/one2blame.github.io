<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/">328. Odd Even
Linked List</a>

Fun problem, pretty intuitive solution. We're given a singly linked list and
asked to relink and return it with a catch - all odd-indexed nodes should be
linked together in a group, and all even-indexed nodes should be linked together
in a group succeeding the odd-indexed node group.

The best way to solve this is with a whiteboard, but afterwards we quickly
identify the edge cases. We just need to make sure that for smaller lists we
don't run into referencing non-existant nodes. Maintain an even and an odd
pointer that we use to traverse and link odd and even nodes together. We also
need a third node to maintain the location of the even list's head.

After successfully linking together the odd and even nodes, we link the odd list
to the even list using the third pointer mentioned ealier. We then return the
head of the list.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
          if not head: return head

          odd = head
          even = conn = head.next

          while even and even.next:
              odd.next = even.next
              odd = odd.next
              even.next = odd.next
              even = even.next

          odd.next = conn

          return head
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain pointers in constant space.
