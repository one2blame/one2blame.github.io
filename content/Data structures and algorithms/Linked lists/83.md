83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List</a>

We've got a sorted linked list but it contains duplicates. We need to remove the
duplicates from the linked list and return it sorted. Luckily for us, it's
already sorted so we just have to remove the duplicates.

To remove the duplicates, we keep track of a current pointer. While the current
pointer and its .next node are valid, we check to see if the .next node's value
is equal to the current node's value. If it is, we unlink it, setting the
current pointer's next node to the .next node's .next node. Othwerwise, we move
the current pointer to the next node.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
          if not head: return head

          dummy = head

          while dummy and dummy.next:
              if dummy.val == dummy.next.val:
                  dummy.next = dummy.next.next
              else:
                  dummy = dummy.next

          return head
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain one pointer.
