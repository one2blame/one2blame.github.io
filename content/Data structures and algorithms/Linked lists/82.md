82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II</a>

A fun question, pretty straightforward. Given a sorted linked list, delete all
nodes that have duplicate members, including the original node. This is kinda
like running uniq on a sorted linked list.

We can solve this by first creating our quintessential dummy node that points to
the head of the original linked list - just in case we end up deleting the first
element. We iterate through the linked list, and if we detect that our next node
is a duplice to the next next node, we track the duplicate value. We continue to
unlink the next node while it exists and its value is equal to the duplicate
value.

If the next node is not a duplicate, we just continue our iteration.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = curr = ListNode(-1, head)

        while curr:
            if curr.next and curr.next.next and curr.next.val == curr.next.next.val:
                dup = curr.next.val

                while curr.next and curr.next.val == dup:
                    curr.next = curr.next.next
            else:
                curr = curr.next

        return dummy.next
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain pointers that occupy constant space.
