1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer</a>

Another simple question, doing some bit arithmetic. We traverse the linked list
from the head to the tail, and for each node, we shift the current value to the
left by 1 and or the value of the current node.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        num = head.val
        while head.next:
            num = (num << 1) | head.next.val
            head = head.next
        return num
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain pointers that occupy constant space.
