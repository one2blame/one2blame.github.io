<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/">24. Swap Nodes in
Pairs</a>

Kinda like reversing a linked list, except we reverse every two nodes. How do we
accomplish this? As always, maintaining a dummy node helps us start the process.
The dummy node will point to the head of the linked list, and be used to keep
track of the pairs as we process them.

Next, we acquire a pointer to the first node and the second node. We point dummy
node to the second node as it's about to become the new head. We then point the
first node to the second node's next node. Then we point the second node to the
first node. The two nodes have been swapped at this point.

Finally, we set the prev node to the first node, which is now techincally the
second node in the pair. We then set the head to the first node of the next
pair. We repeat until head.next or head is None. We finally return dummy.next
which is the head of the linked list.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head

        prev_node = dummy

        while head and head.next:
            first_node = head
            second_node = head.next

            prev_node.next = second_node
            first_node.next = second_node.next
            second_node.next = first_node

            prev_node = first_node
            head = first_node.next

        return dummy.next
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We create one dummy node and a few pointers to traverse the linked list.
