<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-even-length-groups/">
2074. Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups</a>

The most difficult part about this problem is grouping together the nodes in
even length that need to be reversed while also managing the last group that may
not be the same length as the current group length requirement.

What we do to easily solve this is maintain a connector node, this will always
be the node preceding the segment to be reversed. We modify our reversal method
slightly to account for the fact that prev will point to the connector node. We
also maintain a tail node that will be the last node of the newly reversed
segment. In this modified reversal method, curr will end up being the next node
after the segmnet, allowing us to easily link the tail of the segment to the
succeeding nodes.

We only reverse a segment of nodes if the number of nodes we've encountered is
the same as the size of the group, or if curr.next is None - meaning we've
reached the last group. We then check to see if the number of nodes we've
encountered is even. If so, we reverse the segment and set curr to the tail of
the reversed segment.

Then the connector node is set to curr, we increment the group because we're
starting the next one, and we reset the nodes encountered to 0. curr will
continue to iterate, and we'll continue to count the number of nodes
encountered.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def reverseBetween(self, sentinel: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
          prev = sentinel
          curr = sentinel.next
          tail = sentinel.next

          for _ in range(n):
              next_node = curr.next
              curr.next = prev
              prev = curr
              curr = next_node

          sentinel.next = prev
          tail.next = curr
          return tail

      def reverseEvenLengthGroups(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
          conn = None
          curr = head
          group = 1
          node_count = 1

          while curr:
              if group == node_count or not curr.next:
                  if not node_count % 2:
                      curr = self.reverseBetween(connector, node_count)
                  connector = curr
                  group += 1
                  node_count = 0

              node_count += 1
              curr = curr.next

          return head
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain pointers that occupy constant space.
