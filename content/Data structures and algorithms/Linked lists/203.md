203. Remove Linked List Elements</a>

Fairly simple question to answer. Given a linked list and a value, remove all
the nodes that have the given value. Intuition here is to maintain a prev node
that will be used to unlink the node with the given value. A gotcha is the fact
that the linked list has a head node with the given value.

To remedy this, we use a dummy node that will act as a pseudo-head. The rest of
the algorithm requires us to maintain the last time we saw a node that isn't the
given value - this will be prev. curr will be used to evaluate if a node has the
given value, and it will be subsequently unlinked.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = prev = ListNode(-1, head)
        curr = head

        while curr:
            if curr.val == val:
                prev.next = curr.next
            else:
                prev = curr
            curr = curr.next

        return dummy.next
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain pointers that occupy constant space.
