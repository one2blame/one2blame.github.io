<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/">141. Linked List
Cycle</a>

First demonstration of using a fast and slow pointer when traversing a linked
list. We're asked to determine if a linked list has a cycle in it. Using two
pointers, with one going faster than the other by traversing two .next calls, if
the slow and fast pointers ever collide, we know there is a cycle.

If the fast pointer ever reaches None, we know that the linked list is not
cyclic.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = head
        fast = head

        while slow and fast:
            fast = fast.next
            if fast: fast = fast.next
            if slow == fast: return True
            slow = slow.next

        return False
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain two pointers, slow and fast.
