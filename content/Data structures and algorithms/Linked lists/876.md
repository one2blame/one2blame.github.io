<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/">876. Middle
of the Linked List</a>

Given a singly linked list, return the middle element. Pretty straight forward
with a fast and slow pointer. If the fast pointer moves two nodes for every one
node the slow pointer moves, then when the fast pointer reaches the end of the
list, the slow pointer will be at the middle node.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
          slow, fast = head, head.next

          while fast:
              fast = fast.next
              if fast: fast = fast.next
              slow = slow.next

          return slow
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain two pointers, slow and fast.
