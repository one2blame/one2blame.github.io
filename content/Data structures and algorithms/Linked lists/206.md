<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/">206. Reverse Linked
List</a>

Reverse a linked list.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
          curr = head
          prev = None

          while curr:
              temp = curr.next
              curr.next = prev
              prev = curr
              curr = temp

          return prev
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse all nodes within the linked list.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain three pointers, curr, prev, and temp.
