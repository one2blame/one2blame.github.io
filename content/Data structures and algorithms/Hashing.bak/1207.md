<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/">
1207. Unique Number of Occurrences</a>

For this one, we're returning a boolean if the frequency of each integer within
the input array is unique.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        counts = Counter(arr).values()
        return len(counts) == len(set(counts))
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We have to iterate through the entire input array to count frequencies.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the frequency of each number in the input array.
