1394. Find Lucky Integer in an Array</a>

A lucky integer is one that its interger value is the same as its frequency in
the input array. Return the largets lucky integer or, if there isn't one, return
-1.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findLucky(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        counts = Counter(arr)
        ans = -1

        for num, count in counts.items():
            if num == count:
                ans = max(ans, num)

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We have to iterate through the entire input array.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the frequency of each number in the input array.
