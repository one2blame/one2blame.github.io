Maximum Number of Balloons</a>

Given a string, how many times can we create the word "balloon" from the string.
To solve this we just use the Counter class from the collections library in
Python. We acquire a count of each character in the string. Then we find the
minimum count of each character in the word "balloon", accounting for "l" and
"o", which need to be accounted for twice - we do this by divinding their counts
by 2.

The minimum count for any particular character in the string "balloon"
determines the number of times we can create "balloon" from the given input.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfBalloons(self, text: str) -> int:
        count = Counter(text)
        return min(count["b"], count["a"], count["l"] // 2, count["o"] // 2, count["n"])
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We count all occurrences of character in the input.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the occurrence of each character in the input.
