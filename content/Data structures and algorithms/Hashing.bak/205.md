<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/">205. Isomorphic
Strings</a>

This question asks if we can replace the first string with the characters in the
second string in the same order. Initially, you think this would be related to
frequency, but it's not. We still use a hash map to track characters
encountered, however, we actually use the map to map to the other string for our
replacement character.

We basically have two checks, if the characters are not mapped to each other, we
map them. If one of the characters are mapped, we know that there's a
collisions, therefore the string is not isomorphic.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_map = defaultdict(str)
        t_map = defaultdict(str)

        for s_char, t_char in zip(s, t):
            if s_char not in s_map and t_char not in t_map:
                s_map[s_char] = t_char
                t_map[t_char] = s_char

            elif s_map[s_char] != t_char or t_map[t_char] != s_char:
                return False

        return True
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through all characters in both strings.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We store at most 256 characters of hashes in our dictionary.
