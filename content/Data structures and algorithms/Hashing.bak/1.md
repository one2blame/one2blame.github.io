<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/">1. Two Sum</a>

Classic question. We maintain a dictionary of the numbers we've encountered so
far, with the value of each key being the index of the number in the array. As
we iterarte through the array, we find the difference between the target value
and the current number being inspected. If this difference is a key in the
dictionary, we return the index of that number and the index of the current
number.

Without using this dictionary of seen values, we would have to iterate through
the array for each number, resulting in an O(n^2) solution.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        diffs = {}

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num

            if diff in diffs:
                return [diffs[diff], i]

            diffs[num] = i
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the array once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store at most n values in the dictionary.
