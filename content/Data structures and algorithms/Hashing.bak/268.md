<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/">268. Missing Number</a>

Honestly, an annoying question. The optimal answer requires you to recall the
formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. The formula is as follows:

sum = (n \* (n + 1)) // 2

where n is the number of elements in the sequence. We can use this formula to
find the sum of the sequence of numbers from 0 to n. Then, we can subtract the
sum of the given array from the sum of the sequence of numbers from 0 to n. The
result will be the missing number.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return ((len(nums) * (len(nums) + 1)) // 2) - sum(nums)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We calculate the length of the nums array. We also calculate the sum of
the nums array.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We only use a constant amount of space to store the sum of the nums array
and the length of the nums array.
