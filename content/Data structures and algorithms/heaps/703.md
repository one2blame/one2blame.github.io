703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream</a>

We're asked to design a class that will maintain the kth largest element seen in
a stream. It also returns the kth largest elements when new elements are added.
To solve this, we just heapify the input and, while the heap is greater than k,
we continue to pop the heap. The kth largest element is then the top of the
heap.

Why? By default Python uses a min heap. If k == 3, and we keep the heap to size
k, then the minimum element in the heap is the kth largest element. We've
already popped off all of the smaller elements.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        self.k = k
        self.heap = nums
        heapq.heapify(self.heap)

        while len(self.heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(self.heap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.heap, val)

        if len(self.heap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.heap)

        return self.heap[0]
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(nlog(n) + mlog(k)) - The initial nlog(n) is for heapifying the input. The
mlog(k) is for adding m elements to the heap and popping k elements.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We initially store n elements on the heap.
