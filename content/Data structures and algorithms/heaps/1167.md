1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks</a>

This problem is actually pretty closely related to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding
algorithm</a>. We're given a list of sticks and asked to find the minimum cost
to connect them all. The cost is determined by the length of the sticks being
connected. Once a stick is connected to another stick, it's returned to the list
of sticks.

To easily solve this, we use a min heap to maintain the smallest sticks. While
we have more than one stick, we pop the two smallest sticks from the heap, add
them together, record the cost, and push them back onto the heap.

Eventually, we'll have connected all the sticks with the minimum cost to do so.

The solution is as follows:

from heapq import \*

```python
  class Solution:
      def connectSticks(self, sticks: List[int]) -> int:
          heapify(sticks)
          ans, n = 0, len(sticks)

          while n > 1:
              cost = heappop(sticks) + heappop(sticks)
              heappush(sticks, cost)
              ans += cost
              n -= 1

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n log n) - Where n is the number of sticks - process all n sticks. Each heap
operation costs log n time.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store all the sticks in the heap.
