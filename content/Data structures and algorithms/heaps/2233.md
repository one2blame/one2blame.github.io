2233. Maximum Product After K Increments</a>

We're given a list of integers and asked to find the maximum product of the
integers in the list after incrementing any element in the list k times. Hints
that allow us to determine this is a heap oriented problem are:

- The requirement to maximize across a list of elements
- The list is unsorted
- We have k operations to execute

We create a min heap from the input, and then execute the increment operation k
times on the heap, popping the minimum element, adding 1 to it, and pushing back
onto the heap where it is immediately sorted.

We're asked to return the answer, mod 10^9 + 7. To save time, we mod the running
answer scalar variable after every multiplication operation - thanks to the
nature of modulus we'll still end up with the same result, however, we'll avoid
having to handle large integers (which is time consuming).

The solution is as follows:

from heapq import heappush, heappop

```python
  class Solution:
      def maximumProduct(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
          n, mod, ans = len(nums), 10e8 + 7, 1
          heapify(nums)

          for _ in range(k):
              heappush(nums, heappop(nums) + 1)

          for num in nums:
              ans = (ans * num) % mod

          return int(ans)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n + k) - The heapify() operation takes linear time. Pushing and popping from
the heap takes O(1) time, which we execute k times. We operate over each number
in the input when computing the product.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Our heap will be the same size as the input, n.
