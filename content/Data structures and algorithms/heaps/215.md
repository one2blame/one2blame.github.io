215. Kth Largest Element in an Array</a>

Again, another problem that could be easily solved with a heap, however, we can
get a better time complexity using quickselect. Choosing a random pivot, we sort
all numbers less than the pivot into the right array, and all numbers greater
than the pivot into the left array, and all numbers equal to the pivot into the
middle array.

If the length of the left array is greater than or equal to k, we know that our
answer is somewhere in the left array. We recursively call quickselect on the
left array.

If the length of the left and middle array combined are less than k, we know
that our answer is somewhere in the right array. We subtract the sizes of the
left and middle array from k and recursively call quickselect on the right
array.

If both of these decisions return false, we know our answer is in the middle
array, and we return the pivot.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
          def quick_select(nums, k):
              pivot = random.choice(nums)
              left, mid, right = [], [], []

              for num in nums:
                  if num > pivot:
                      left.append(num)
                  elif num < pivot:
                      right.append(num)
                  else:
                      mid.append(num)

              if k <= len(left):
                  return quick_select(left, k)

              if len(left) + len(mid) < k:
                  return quick_select(right, k - len(left) - len(mid))

              return pivot

          return quick_select(nums, k)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - The quickselect time complexity is O(n) on average.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We have to use space to store the arrays.
