1962. Remove Stones to Minimize the Total</a>

Given an array of piles, piles[i] represents the number of stones in the ith
pile. For exactly k operations, we can choose any pile and halve it. We want to
minimize the total number of stones in the piles after k operations.

We use a max heap to maintain the largest pile at heap[0]. During each
operation, we halve the largest pile and put it back into the heap. We then
repeat this process k times. We then return the sum of the piles.

The solution is as follows:

from heapq import \* from math import ceil

```python
  class Solution:
      def minStoneSum(self, piles: List[int], k: int) -> int:
          piles = [-pile for pile in piles]
          heapify(piles)

          for i in range(k):
              heappush(piles, -(ceil(-heappop(piles) / 2)))

          return sum([-pile for pile in piles])
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n + k \* log n) - Heap operations take O(log n) time, we process n piles and
perform k operations.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a heap of all piles.
