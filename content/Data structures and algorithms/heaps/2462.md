2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers</a>

We're given a list of workers and asked to hire them in k rounds. We're allowed
to pick candidates workers from the list, starting from the front and the back
of the list during each round. The cheaper candidate will be added to the total
cost, and removed from future consideration. Ties are broken by index in the
list.

To solve this, we maintain two pointers for our front and back processing of
candidates. As we eliminate candidates from consideration, depending on which
half of the list we choose from, we'll move the pointer forward.

All of the candidates selected by the two pointers, from the head and tail, are
added to a heap. As candidates leave the heap, new candidates are pushed from
the head or tail of the list, depending on which half of the list they were
selected from.

Once the head and tail cross each other, we stop pushing candidates to the heap
to avoid duplicates.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush

class Solution:
    def totalCost(self, costs: List[int], k: int, candidates: int) -> int:
        n, h, ans = len(costs), [], 0
        next_head, next_tail = candidates, n - 1 - candidates

        for i in range(candidates):
            h.append((costs[i], 0))

        for i in range(max(candidates, n - candidates), n):
            h.append((costs[i], 1))

        heapify(h)

        for _ in range(k):
            cost, section = heappop(h)
            ans += cost

            if next_head <= next_tail:
                if section == 0:
                    heappush(h, (costs[next_head], 0))
                    next_head += 1
                else:
                    heappush(h, (costs[next_tail], 1))
                    next_tail -= 1

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O((k + m) \* log(m)) - We conduct k rounds of hiring, and for each round, we
push and pop from the heap, which has a size of m.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(m) - Where m is the number of candidates we're considering.
