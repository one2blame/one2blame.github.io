<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/">692. Top K
Frequent Words</a>

We're asked to find the k most frequent words in a list of words. Super easy to
solve with a min heap. First, we grab the frequency of each word from the input
list. We iterate through the words and their frequency and maintain a min heap
of size k. Maintenance in this case means that, when the heap's size is greater
than k, we pop the top element from the heap. This way, the top element is
always the minimum of the greatest k elements.

Finally, we sort our heap in descending order and return the result.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import Counter from heapq import heappush, heappop

class Pair: def **init**(self, word, freq): self.word = word self.freq = freq

      def __lt__(self, p):
          return self.freq < p.freq or (self.freq == p.freq and self.word > p.word)

```python
  class Solution:
      def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
          cnt = Counter(words)
          h = []
          for word, freq in cnt.items():
              heappush(h, Pair(word, freq))
              if len(h) > k:
                  heappop(h)
          return [p.word for p in sorted(h, reverse=True)]
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(nlog(k)) - The usual time complexity for a heap when maintaining a heap of
size k.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store n elements in the heap in the worst case.
