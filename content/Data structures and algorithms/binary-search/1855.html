1855. Maximum Distance Between a Pair of Values</a>

We could use binary search for each number in nums1 to find the lowest number in nums2 that is
greater than or equal to our current selection. Then we bisect candidate numbers and maximize our
answer.

This is suboptimal to a two pointers solution where we iterate through both lists and increment the
pointer of the list with the smaller number. We update our answer when we find a pair that satisfies
our condition.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        ans, i, j = 0, 0, 0

        while i < len(nums1) and j < len(nums2):
            if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                ans = max(ans, j - i)
                j += 1

        return ans


_ Time Complexity:

  O(m + n) - We use two pointers and iterate through both lists.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(1) - We use constant space to retain our variables.
