1870. Minimum Speed to Arrive on Time</a>

We're given a list of distances that multiple trains cover, and we need to travel using each train
in hour number of hours. We need to find the minimum speed (kilometers per hour) the trains need to
travel in order to reach our destination before the provided hour.

We use binary search, where our search space is given to us - 1 to 10e7. During each step of the
binary search, we calculate the amount of hours it would take, t, to travel the n - 1 distances with
the trains at the currently selected speed, m. For each calculation, we use ceil() to summarize to
the next hour - each train can only take off for integer times, not floating point numbers. Finally,
we process the nth train, and retain it's floating point result because we've reached our
destination.

If we reach the destination faster or equal to the time provided, we shift the binary search left -
the trains can probably go slower. Otherwise, we shift the binary search right - the trains need to
go faster.

Eventually, we find the minimum speed it will take for us to reach our destination on time.

The solution is as follows:


  from math import ceil

  class Solution:
      def minSpeedOnTime(self, dist: List[int], hour: float) -> int:
          l, r, n, ans = 1, 10e7, len(dist), -1

          while l <= r:
              m, t = (r + l) // 2, 0

              for i in range(n - 1):
                  t += ceil(dist[i] / m)
              t += dist[n - 1] / m

              if t <= hour:
                  ans = m
                  r = m - 1
              else:
                  l = m + 1

          return int(ans)


_ Time Complexity:

  O(n log(k)) - Where n is the number of trains and their distances, and k is the search space of
  (1, 10e7).

_ Space Complexity:

  O(1) - We use constant space to retain our variables.
