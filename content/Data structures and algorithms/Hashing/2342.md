2342. Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits</a>

This is a fun one. We're given an array of integers and we're asked to find the
maximum sum we can create with pairs of integers in the list that have the same
sum of their digits. So for this, we have to recall a trick to sum the digits of
an interger - involves some modulo math.

After we've remembered that, solving this is trivial. Using the sum of the
digits of an integer as our hashing function, we'll maintain a dictionary to
keep track of the largest value we've encountered for a particular digit hash.
As we iterate through all the numbers in the list, if we find a hash collision,
we sum the number currently being inspected with the number we've stored in the
dictionary, maximizing the sums we've seen across the entire iteration.

Finally, we keep the biggest of the two numbers in the hash collision, because
we care about maintaining the largest sum we've seen so far.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def sumDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        s = 0
        while num:
            s += num % 10
            num //= 10
        return s

    def maximumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seen = defaultdict(int)
        ans = -1

        for num in nums:
            s = self.sumDigits(num)

            if s in seen:
                ans = max(ans, num + seen[s])

            seen[s] = max(seen[s], num)

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the input list once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store at most n values in the seen dictionary.
