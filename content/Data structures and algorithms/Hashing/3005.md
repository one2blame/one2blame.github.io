3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency</a>

Given an array of integers, sum the counts of the integers that appear the most.
Use the Counter class from the collections package to count the occurrences of
each integer. Calculate the max count and sum the counts of the integers that
have a count equal to the max count.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def maxFrequencyElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        counts = Counter(nums)
        max_freq = max(counts.values())
        return sum([counts[num] for num in counts if counts[num] == max_freq])
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the array to count all the integers.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the count of each interger.
