<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/">64. Minimum Path Sum</a>

Similar to the previous question, <a href="62.html">62. Unique Paths</a>, we traverse nodes on a
graph represented by a 2D matrix. Each node has a cost, we asked to find the minimum path sum from
node (0, 0) to (m - 1, n - 1).

We start from the end and work backwards, reusing the existing matrix so that way we don't have to
duplicate a matrix and store our answer there. If we're at the edge of the matrix, we reuse values
from the cell below or to the right, adding the value to our current grid location - this is the
only direction we can go so.

If we're in a position where we can access the results of both right or down without an
out-of-bounds reference, we choose the minimum of the two path directions and add it to our current
node. The reuse of these values eventually cascades into (0, 0) containing the minimum path sum -
and we've done all this via memoization and dynamic programming.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
      def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
          m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

          for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
              for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                  if i == m - 1 and j != n - 1:
                      grid[i][j] += grid[i][j + 1]
                  elif i != m - 1 and j == n - 1:
                      grid[i][j] += grid[i + 1][j]
                  elif i != m - 1 and j != n - 1:
                      grid[i][j] += min(grid[i + 1][j], grid[i][j + 1])

          return grid[0][0]


_ Time Complexity:

  O(m * n) - Where m is the number of rows, and n is the number of columns, this solution requires
  polynomial time to calculate the minimum path sum.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(1) - We reuse the existing space provided in the input.
