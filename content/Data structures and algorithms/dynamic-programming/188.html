188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV</a>

Relate to other "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" problems, this problem allows at most k
transactions, that being buying and selling a stock. Like most dynamic programming problems, we think
of states and actions.

What are the states? Well there's the current day and its price, whether or not we currently hold the
stock, and how many transactions we've made so far. Also, a transaction is only complete if we buy
and then sell.

What are the actions? We can either buy, sell, or do nothing.

With that, we essentially search our way to the right answer - DFS and dynamic programming are pretty
closely related. Recursively, we start at day 0, we don't hold the stock, and we still have k
transactions to make. We can either do nothing, buy the stock, or if we currently hold the stock we
can sell it. At each state, we maximize for profit.

To terminate the search, if we reach the last day or we've made all k transactions, we return 0.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
      def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
          n = len(prices)

          @cache
          def dp(i: int, h: bool, j: int) -> int:
              if i == n or j == 0:
                  return 0

              ans = dp(i + 1, h, j)

              if h:
                  ans = max(ans, prices[i] + dp(i + 1, False, j - 1))
              else:
                  ans = max(ans, -prices[i] + dp(i + 1, True, j))

              return ans

          return dp(0, False, k)


_ Time Complexity:

  O(n * k) - Where n is the number of days and k is the number of transactions. This is a typical
  time complexity of DFS, we just applied it to a dynamic programming problem.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(n * k) - Our recursive call stack can grow to a maximum of n * k.
