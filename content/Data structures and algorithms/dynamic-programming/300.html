<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/">
300. Longest Increasing Subsequence</a>

Another quintessential dynamic programming problem. Often, we try to get linear or logarithmic
performance from LeetCode solutions, however, dynamic programming solutions usually end up being
polynomial in time complexity. This is one of those cases.

We're asked to find the longest subsequence in the given list of integers, nums, such that all the
integers in the selected subsequence are strictly increasing. To achieve this, we iterate from 0 to
n - 1, where n is the length of the input, and during each iteration we iterate again from 0 to
i - 1.

We maintain a table of previous selections, these being the length of the longest increasing
subsequence up to that point, dp[i]. During our second iteration with index j, if nums[j] is less
than nums[i], nums[j] is part of the subsequence we're looking for, and so at dp[i] we take the
maximum of the current answer we have for dp[i] versus dp[j] + 1 - adding nums[j] to the
subsequence, essentially.

Typical of dynamic programming solutions, we're using memoization to reuse precomputed answers to
previous problems solved earlier in our iteration.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
      def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          dp = [1] * len(nums)

          for i in range(1, len(nums)):
              for j in range(i):
                  if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

          return max(dp)


_ Time Complexity:

  O(n^2) - Where n is the length of nums, for each num, i, we iterate through 0 to i - 1.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(n) - We maintain a table of longest increasing subsequences up to the ith index.
