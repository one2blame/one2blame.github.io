<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-enclaves/">1020. Number of Enclaves</a>

Given a 2D matrix of 1s and 0s, we're asked to treat 1s and connected 1s as islands, and 0s as water.
We're asked to find the number of 1s that are not on the boundary of the matrix. We can solve this by
inspecting each cell in the grid - if the cell contains land we conduct a DFS.

During our DFS, if we detect a boundary for this island, we return the count of 0 for this island. We
then add this count to our answer. Otherwise, during our DFS we count the number of 1s in this island
and return this count, adding it to our answer.

The seen set from our DFS prevents us from conducting DFS on the same island multiple times.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
      def numEnclaves(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
          n, m, ans = len(grid), len(grid[0]), 0
          directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
          self.seen = set()

          def is_valid(y: int, x: int) -> bool:
              return -1 < y < n and -1 < x < m

          def dfs(q: int, p: int) -> int:
              count = 0
              boundary = False
              stack = [(q, p)]

              while stack:
                  y, x = stack.pop()
                  count += 1

                  for dy, dx in directions:
                      ny, nx = y + dy, x + dx

                      if is_valid(ny, nx):
                          if grid[ny][nx] and (ny, nx) not in self.seen:
                              self.seen.add((ny, nx))
                              stack.append((ny, nx))
                      else:
                          boundary = True

              return count if not boundary else 0

          for i in range(n):
              for j in range(m):
                  if grid[i][j] and (i, j) not in self.seen:
                      self.seen.add((i, j))
                      ans += dfs(i, j)
          
          return ans


_ Time Complexity:

  O(n * m) - DFS is O(n + m) and we visit each cell in the matrix.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(n * m) - In the worst case, we maintain a seen set the same size as the matrix.
