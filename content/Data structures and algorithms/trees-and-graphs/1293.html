<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/">
1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination</a>

Hard question, for sure. With a n x m grid, we're asked to start at location (0, 0) and make our way
to (n - 1, m - 1). We can move up, down, left, and right. There are obstacles in the way, and we're
given k opportunities to destroy obstacles.

This is similar to a different problem where we need to travel from (0, 0) to (n - 1, m - 1). To
solve this, we can conduct a BFS and maintain the number of obstacles we can still destroy as part
of the state for each cell / node as we travese the graph. Like always, we maintain a set of seen
locations to avoid visiting the same cell twice. If we still have opportunities to destroy obstacles
remaining during our travels, we decrement the remain counter and pass this information to the next
step.

If we reach a cell and the neighbors are obstacles but we have no opportunities to destroy them, the
traversal for this path in the BFS ends. If we reach the destination, we return the number of steps,
otherwise we return -1.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
      def shortestPath(self, grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
          n = len(grid)
          m = len(grid[0])

          def is_valid(row: int, col: int) -> bool:
              return -1 < row < n and -1 < col < m

          seen = {(0, 0, k)}
          queue = [(0, 0, k, 0)]
          directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

          while queue:
              curr_queue, queue = queue, []

              for row, col, remain, steps in curr_queue:
                  if row == n - 1 and col == m - 1:
                      return steps

                  for dy, dx in directions:
                      nrow, ncol = row + dy, col + dx

                      if is_valid(nrow, ncol):
                          if grid[nrow][ncol] == 0:
                              if (nrow, ncol, remain) not in seen:
                                  seen.add((nrow, ncol, remain))
                                  queue.append((nrow, ncol, remain, steps + 1))
                          elif remain and (nrow, ncol, remain - 1) not in seen:
                              seen.add((nrow, ncol, remain - 1))
                              queue.append((nrow, ncol, remain - 1, steps + 1))

          return -1


_ Time Complexity:

  O(n * k) - BFS takes O(n) time. For each cell, at most, it will be visited k times.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(n * k) - We use a queue to implement BFS and can contain states with k.
