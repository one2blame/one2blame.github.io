208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)</a>

This question just asks us to implement the trie (pronounced "try") data structure. A trie is a
tree-based data structure used to catalogue words to make them easily searchable. This is great for
solutions like auto-complete, etc. We're asked to implement the insert, startsWith, and search
methods for the class.

Before we implement the class, we have to define a TrieNode. TrieNodes allow us to easily search the
trie. The attributes will be whether or not the node represents a word, and the children of the
node. Children will be other TrieNodes that are the succeeding letter for a word inserted into the
trie.

During insertion, we continuously create new nodes for letters that haven't been seen in the current
path, otherwise we just traverse the path of the trie until we encounter a letter that hasn't been
seen, yet. Once we hit the end of the word, we mark the leaf node's attribute .isWord as True.

During startsWith(), we don't care to find the leaf node, we just see if we can traverse the entire
trie with the prefix provided. If not, we know that words with the provided prefix don't exist in
the trie, so we return False. If we're able to search the entire prefix, we know that some word in
this trie starts with the prefix provided, so we return True.

During search(), we follow the path(s) of the trie to the very end of the word provided and check
if the .isWord attribute is marked as True for the leaf node. We either make it to the end and
return True, or we fail to find the word and return False.

The solution is as follows:


  class TrieNode:
      def __init__(self):
          self.isWord = False
          self.children = {}


  class Trie:
      def __init__(self):
          self.root = TrieNode()

      def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
          curr = self.root

          for char in word:
              if char not in curr.children:
                  curr.children[char] = TrieNode()

              curr = curr.children[char]

          curr.isWord = True

      def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
          curr = self.root

          for char in prefix:
              if char not in curr.children:
                  return False

              curr = curr.children[char]

          return True

      def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
          curr = self.root

          for char in word:
              if char not in curr.children:
                  return False

              curr = curr.children[char]

          return curr.isWord


_ Time Complexity:

  O(l) - Where l is the length of the word provided during each opeartion, i.e. insert(), search(),
  or startsWith().

_ Space Complexity:

  O(l) - Where l is the length of the word provided during the insert() operation, in the worst case
  we create l nodes.
