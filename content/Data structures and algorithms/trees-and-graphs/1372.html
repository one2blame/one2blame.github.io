1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree</a>

We're asked to find the longest path in a binary tree that zig zags, bouncing from the left and
right nodes and vice versa for as long as possible. This longest path can start at any node in the
tree. To solve this, we maintain a global answer variable that we maximize across all paths. We
recursively execute DFS on the tree, and each time we call the DFS function on the left or right
nodes, we alternate the count of the path length. This way, if we visit left twice in a row, or
right twice in a row, the count resets to 1.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
      def longestZigZag(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
          self.ans = 0

          def dfs(node: Optional[TreeNode], left: int, right: int) -> None:
              if not node:
                  return

              self.ans = max(self.ans, max(left, right))
              dfs(node.left, right + 1, 0)
              dfs(node.right, 0, left + 1)

          dfs(root, 0, 0)
          return self.ans


_ Time Complexity:

  O(n) - We traverse O(n) nodes of the tree.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(n) - The recursive call stack can reach O(n) in the worst case.
