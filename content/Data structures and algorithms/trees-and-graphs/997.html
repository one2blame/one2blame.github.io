<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/">997. Find the Town Judge</a>

The judge is a node in the graph with only indegrees, no outdegrees. We process all edges and count
the indegrees vs the outdegrees. The judge will have n - 1 indegrees and 0 outdegrees.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
      def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
          score = [0] * (n + 1)

          for u, v in trust:
              score[u] -= 1
              score[v] += 1

          for node in range(1, n + 1):
              if score[node] == n - 1:
                  return node

          return -1


_ Time Complexity:

  O(e) - Where e is the number of edges.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(n) - Where n is the number of nodes.
