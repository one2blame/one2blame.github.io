<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/">242. Valid Anagram</a>

Given an string, return True or False if it's a valid anagram. An anagram is a
word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
typically using all the original letters exactly once. We can solve this problem
by sorting both strings and comparing them. If they're equal, we return True,
otherwise, we return False.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import Counter

```python
  class Solution:
      def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
          return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n + m) - Where n is the size of s and m is the size of t, we count the
frequency of characters in both strings.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n + m) - We store character counts for each string in a Counter object.
