<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/">169. Majority
Element</a>

We're given an array of integers and asked to find the majority element, such
that it appears more than n // 2 times in the array.

Using the Boyer-Moore voting algorithm, we'll always pick a candidate for the
majority element when our count for the candidate is 0. Each time we see the
candidate, we add 1 to the count, otherwise we add -1. If the count resets to 0,
the next element in the array will be the candidate.

Eventually, we process all numbers in the array and discover the majority
element, as we'll always eventually have an instance where the count is positive
and finds the majority element.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          c, candidate = 0, None

          for num in nums:
              if not c:
                  candidate = num

              c += 1 if num == candidate else -1

          return candidate
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through all integers in the input.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We use constant space to store the count and candidate.
