<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/">344. Reverse String</a>

This problem requires us to provide a solution that reverses an input string
in-place, meaning we cannot allocate an additional array in memory to store our
reversed string.

This is a common two-pointers problem, wherein, we maintain two pointers to
locations within the array, one at the beginning and one at the end. We continue
to swap the characters in the array pointed to by the two pointers until the two
pointers cross, incrementing the leftmost pointer and decrementing the rightmost
pointer on each iteration.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
          l, r = 0, len(s) - 1

          while l < r:
              s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]

              l += 1
              r -= 1
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Using two pointers, we iterate
over the string n/2 times, which resolves to O(n).

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1), since we are not allocating any additional memory to store our reversed
string.
