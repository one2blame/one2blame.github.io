<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-only-letters/">917. Reverse Only
Letters</a>

Pretty fun problem, requires two-pointers to reverse a string, however, we've
got to make some decisions to conduct a no-op (no-operation) on non-alphabetic
characters. We create a left and right pointer and, while the pointers haven't
crossed, we check to see if the characters at the left and right pointer are
alphabetic. If they both are, we swap the characters pointed to by the
pointers - an important distinction from the different decisions.

If the left pointer is non-alpha, but the right is, the left pointer is
incrememnted. Same goes for the right pointer. Finally, if both are non-alpha,
we increment both pointers. These situations are our no-op outcomes.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution(object):
      def reverseOnlyLetters(self, S):
          ans = list(S)
          l, r = 0, len(ans) - 1

          while l < r:
              l_alpha, r_alpha = ans[l].isalpha(), ans[r].isalpha()

              if l_alpha and r_alpha:
                  ans[l], ans[r] = ans[r], ans[l]
                  l += 1
                  r -= 1
              elif l_alpha and not r_alpha:
                  r -= 1
              elif r_alpha and not l_alpha:
                  l += 1
              else:
                  l += 1
                  r -= 1

          return "".join(ans)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the string once in O(n/2) time, which is O(n).

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We convert the string to a list, storing n characters in memory.
