643. Maximum Average Subarray I</a>

This is a sliding window problem, which is closely related to two-pointers.
We're also maximizing the value of subarrays defined within the larger array. So
the patterns we'll notice here are a sliding window, two pointers, and a
function (max) used to evalute each subarray defined by the sliding window.

Given k, the length of the window, we iterate through the array until we reach
the kth element, summing the contents of the subarray defined by array[0:k].
Then from array[k:n], we add the current value, array[i], and subtract the value
at array[i-k], maintaining the sliding window.

Our function (max) is used to compare the previous sliding window to the current
sliding window, and we retain the maximum value. Once we've iterated through the
entire array, we return the maximum average value of all subarrays discovered in
the input.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
          curr = 0
          for i in range(k):
              curr += nums[i]

          ans = curr
          for i in range(k, len(nums)):
              curr += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
              ans = max(ans, curr)

          return ans / k
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the array once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We don't use any additional space.
