<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms/">252. Meeting Rooms</a>

We're given a list of intervals of the type List[List[int, int]] where intervals[i][0]
is the start time for a meeting, and intervals[i][1] is the end time. Can a person
attend all the meetings? Return True if so, otherwise False.

We sort the input, that way all meetings are sorted by when they start. Then we
begin to iterate through the meetings, from 0 to the penultimate meeting. If the
end time of the current meeting is greater than the start of the next meeting,
we return False. Eventually, we'll return True.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        intervals.sort()
        n = len(intervals)

        for i in range(n - 1):
            if intervals[i][1] > intervals[i + 1][0]:
                return False

        return True
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(nlogn) - We sort the input.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Sorting in Python requires n space.
