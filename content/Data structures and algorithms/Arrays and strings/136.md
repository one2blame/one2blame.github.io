<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/">136. Single Number</a>

We're given an array of integers where every single integer appears twice except
for one. We're asked to find it. This is an array question, but it's also a bit
manipulation question. We'll maintain a running scalar variable that keep the
result of an XOR operation between the scalar variable and the current number in
the array. Because of the nature of XOR, duplicate numbers in the input will
cancel each other out. Eventually, the integer with no duplicate will remain in
the scalar variable.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          ans = 0

          for num in nums:
              ans ^= num

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We process all integers in the input.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain a single scalar variable.
