Consecutive Ones III</a>

Another sliding window problem, however, the size of the subarray we're looking
for isn't statically defined - the window is dynamic and grows and shrinks
depending upon how we satisfy the maximization function. Our maximization
function is to find a subarray that contains at most k zeroes.

To solve this, we maintain a left and right pointer for the sliding window. Also
maintain a count of zeros we've encountered as we expand the sliding window to
the right. If the number of zeroes we've encountered becomes greater than k,
while the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer, we shrink the
window by incrementing the left pointer. During this process, we also check to
see if we've found another 0 in our subarray. If so, we decrement the count.

These two conditions, zero being less than k and shrinking the window from the
left, allows us to dynamically size the array to search for the correct
subarray.

As we traverse the array, we maintain the maximum size of the subarray that
satisfies our conditions.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left = ans = count = 0

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] == 0: count += 1

            while left <= right and count > k:
                if nums[left] == 0: count -= 1
                left += 1

            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse the array once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - No memory outside of integers are used to maintain the solution.
