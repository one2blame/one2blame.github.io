<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-vowels-in-a-substring-of-given-length/">
1456. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length</a>

Sliding window problem. We've got a string and a constraint, k, wherein the
sliding window can be no greater than k. To solve this problem we create a set
of vowels so we can easily check if a character is in the set.

Following this, we evaluate the first window up until k, adding characters that
are in the vowels set to our global total. Once that's done, we iterate through
the rest of the string starting from k. We add to our total if the character
we're currently inspecting is in the vowel set. We substract from our total if
the s[i-k] character is in the vowel set, maintaining the constraints of the
sliding window.

We maximize this constraint across all subarrays discovered.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowels, ans, total = set("aeiou"), 0, 0

        for i in range(k): total += int(s[i] in vowels)

        ans = total
        for j in range(k, len(s)):
            total += int(s[j] in vowels)
            total -= int(s[j - k] in vowels)
            ans = max(ans, total)

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the string once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We use a set of vowels, but the size of the set is constant.
