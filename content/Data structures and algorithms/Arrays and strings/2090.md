2090. K Radius Subarray Averages</a>

Sliding window problem where we maintain an array of averages for a window of
size 2*k+1. To facilitate this solution, we go ahead and create an array to
store our result. We also check to see if the size of the window 2*k+1 is
greater than the size of the array, n. If so, just return an array of -1.

First we calculate the average of the first window, and place the result at
array[k]. We iterate through the array from k+1 to n-k. Like always with our
sliding window solutions, we subtract the left hand amount, array[i - k + 1],
from the total and add the right hand amount, array[i + k]. We calcuate the
average and set array[i] to the result.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def getAverages(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
          if k == 0: return nums

          n = len(nums)
          averages = [-1] * n

          if 2 * k + 1 > n: return averages

          window_sum = sum(nums[:2 * k + 1])
          averages[k] = window_sum // (2 * k + 1)
          for i in range(k + 1, n - k):
              window_sum = window_sum - nums[i - (k + 1)] + nums[i + k]
              averages[i] = window_sum // (2 * k + 1)

          return averages
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse the array once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain an array of size n to store our result.
