<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/">209. Minimum
Size Subarray Sum</a>

Behold, a sliding window problem but this time we're minimizing the size of the
sliding window. We want the smallest window that gives us the greatest value
over the array. Following the usual paradigm, we're going to maintain a left and
right pointer, and a globally available total and answer variable.

Traversing from left to right, we add each number at the current index to the
total. If the total is equal to or exceeds the target, we compare the current
window size to the current minimum window size (which we originally set to
infinity), and retain the smaller of the two. We subtract the current value from
the total and then increment the left pointer, shrinking the window.

We continue to do this until we've processed every subarray that fits our
constraints. If our current answer is still infinity, that means we failed to
find a subarray greater than or equal to our target. In this case, we return 0.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        l, total, ans = 0, 0, float('inf')

        for r in range(n):
            total += nums[r]

            while (total >= target):
                ans = min(ans, r - l + 1)
                total -= nums[l]
                l += 1

        return ans if ans != float('inf') else 0
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse the array once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We only use a constant amount of space.
