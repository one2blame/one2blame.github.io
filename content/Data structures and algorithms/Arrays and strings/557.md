557. Reverse Words in a String III</a>

This is barely a LeetCode question, but we're documenting the solution, anyways.
We're asked to reverse every word in an array, but maintain their position in
the array. With Python, this is pretty trivial.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
          return " ".join(word[::-1] for word in s.split())
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the entire array once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - I'm sure Python creates a new array in the background when processing
this one-liner.
