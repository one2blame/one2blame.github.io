<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-prefix-of-word/">2000. Reverse
Prefix of Word</a>

This is a two-pointers problem that requires us to search for a specific
character prior to reversing the substring defined by the beginning of the array
and the position of the found character.

Pretty straightfoward, iterate through the array until we find the character,
then reverse the substring. We maintain a pointer to the beginning of the array
and use it to reverse characters with the iterator defined to find the end of
the substring.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def reversePrefix(self, word: str, ch: str) -> str:
          i, ans = 0, list(word)
          for j in range(len(ans)):
              if ans[j] == ch:
                  while i < j:
                      ans[i], ans[j] = ans[j], ans[i]
                      i += 1
                      j -= 1

                  return "".join(ans)

          return "".join(ans)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the array once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We create a new array to store the reversed substring.
