2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence</a>

Given two strings, s and t, we're asked to add characters to s to make t a
subsequence of s. A subsequence is not a substring, the characters don't have to
be contiguous, however, they do need to be in the same order as they appear in
t.

This is a greedy problem. By default, we're going to assume that all the
characters in t need to be appended to s to make t a subsequence of s. Then
we're going to traverse s and t from left to right, checking the characters at
each position. We're essentially seeing if the characters in t appear in the
same as order as s.

If s[i] == t[j], we've got a match and so we decrement our answer, the number of
characters we need to append to s is less now because the character found in t
is in the same order as s. We increment j, we're now looking at the next
character in t. By default, we'll always increment i.

By the end of this iteration, we'll have found all the characters in s that
appear in the same order as t, and subtracted them from our answer - we don't
need to append them. The remaining answer is the number of characters we need to
append to s to make t a subsequence of s.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def appendCharacters(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        m, n = len(s), len(t)
        ans = n
        i = j = 0

        while i < m and j < n:
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                ans -= 1
                j += 1

            i += 1

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate over each character in s.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We store our answer in a single variable.
