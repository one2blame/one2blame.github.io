Stitching</a>

We're given an array of intervals, (start, end), and a time. We're asked to find
the minimum number of intervals we can use in this array to cover 0 - time. This
is a regular greedy algorithm question.

We start by sorting the input with a compound key - we'll sort based on start
time, but also sort end time in decreasing order. We want to start filling in
the time from 0, but we also want to pick intervals that cover the most time
from start to end. We keep track of the most recently seen and greatest end
time.

We start popping from the clips list. We remove all clips that have an end time
less than or equal to the greatest end we've seen so far. We already cover those
time slots, why would we keep those intervals?

For all the clips that have a start time less than or equal to the greatest end
we've seen so far, we find the clip with the greatest end time - this will cover
the most time as we stitch the video together. If we can't find a next greater
end time, and we still have clips leftover, that means that we have time missing
in our clip intervals - so we can't stitch everything together. We return -1 in
this case.

We update the new greatest end time, and increment our answer by 1 to note we've
chosen an interval. If the greatest end time recorded is ever greater than or
equal to our target end time, we return the number of intervals chosen.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def videoStitching(self, clips: List[List[int]], time: int) -> int:
        clips.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        end = ans = 0
        next_end = float("-inf")

        while clips:
            while clips and clips[0][1] <= end:
                clips.pop(0)

            while clips and clips[0][0] <= end:
                next_end = max(next_end, clips.pop(0)[1])

            if next_end == end and clips:
                return -1

            end = next_end
            ans += 1

            if end >= time:
                return ans

        return -1
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n log(n)) - We have to sort the input.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Python sorting takes O(n) space.

Alternative counting sort answer with O(n) time and O(n) space:

```python
  class Solution:
      def videoStitching(self, clips: List[List[int]], time: int) -> int:
          max_length = [0] * (time + 1)

          for i in range(len(clips)):
              start, end = max(0, min(time, clips[i][0])), min(time, clips[i][1])
              max_length[start] = max(max_length[start], end)

          ans = curr_end = next_end = 0

          for i in range(time + 1):
              if i > next_end:
                  return -1

              if i > curr_end:
                  ans += 1
                  curr_end = next_end

              next_end = max(next_end, max_length[i])

          return ans





```
