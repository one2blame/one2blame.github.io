1710. Maximum Units on a Truck</a>

Regular greedy problem, we've got a truck that can take truckSize boxes. We've
got boxes described by the number we have and the units contained within each.
To solve this greedily, we sort the input based on number of units. We then
iterate through the input, selecting the highest number of boxes we can add to
the truck (either truckSize number of boxes or the boxes available for this
iteration). We add the number of units to our running total, and decrement the
truckSize by the number of boxes we just added. If there's no more space, we
terminate.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumUnits(self, boxTypes: List[List[int]], truckSize: int) -> int:
        boxTypes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        ans = 0

        for boxes, units in boxTypes:
            select = min(truckSize, boxes)
            ans += units * select
            truckSize -= select

            if not truckSize:
                break

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n log(n)) - We have to sort the input.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We use constant space.
