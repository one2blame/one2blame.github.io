<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-with-a-given-numeric-value/">
1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value</a>

We're asked to create a string of size n with a value k where each letter from
a - z is valued 1 - 26. The string should be lexicographically smallest,
essentially the chatacters should be in increasing order from left to right.

This is a greedy problem, easily solvable by selecting the largest possible
character at each location, starting from the right. We create an array of 0's
of size n, then iterate from n - 1 to 0. At each location, we select min(k -
i, 26) where i is our current position in the string. This helps us maintain an
idea of how many characters are remaining for selection.

After we select a character, we decrement k by the value of the character and
store the character in the answer array at the current position.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def getSmallestString(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        ans = [0] * n

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            char = min(k - i, 26)
            k -= char
            ans[i] = chr(char + ord('a') - 1)

        return "".join(ans)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate n times to select n characters.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store our answer in an array of size n.
