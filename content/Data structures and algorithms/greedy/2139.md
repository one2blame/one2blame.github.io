2139. Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score</a>

We're given an integer, target, that we want to reach with the minimum amount of
operations. The operations we can conduct or multiply by 2, and increment by 1.
We also have an integer, maxDoubles, the maximum number of times we can multiply
by 2. We need to return the minimum number of operations required to reach the
target.

We solve this problem greedily, and work backwards. While we have maxDoubles
left and the target is greater than 1, if the target is even and greater than 2,
we multiply by 2 and decremenet maxDoubles by 1. Otherwise, we decrement the
target by 1. After conducting either operation, we'll increment the number of
operations we've done so far by 1.

Eventually, target will be equal to 1, and we'll return the minimum number of
operations needed to reach target.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def minMoves(self, target: int, maxDoubles: int) -> int:
          ans = 0

          while target > 1 and maxDoubles:
              if not target % 2 and target != 2:
                  maxDoubles -= 1
                  target = target // 2
              else:
                  target -= 1

              ans += 1

          return ans + target - 1
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - Where n is the target, we iterate n times in the worst case.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We use constant space to track number of operations.
