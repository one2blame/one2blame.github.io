1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations</a>

We're given an array of integers and asked to maximize it's sum after k
negations, with a negation being the operation of changing a number to it's
negative value. We solve this by using a min heap to keep track of the smallest
number. We always want to negate the smallest number because it will have the
minimal effect on the sum. We negate the smallest number k times and return the
sum of the array.

The solution is as follows:

from heapq import heapify, heappush, heappop

```python
  class Solution:
      def largestSumAfterKNegations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
          heapify(nums)

          for _ in range(k):
              heappush(nums, -heappop(nums))

          return sum(nums)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* log(n)) - We heapify conduct n heap operations.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store n elements in the heap.
