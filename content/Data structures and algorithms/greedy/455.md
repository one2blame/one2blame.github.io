<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/">455. Assign Cookies</a>

We have a list of children with greed[i] and a list of cookies with size s[i].
Children will only accept cookies that fit the constaint s[i] >= greed[i].

Regular greedy problem, we could solve this with a max heap or sort, either way
they have the same time and space complexity. Solving it with sort, we'll
maintain a pointer to the current cookie and a pointer to the child.

If the child will accept the cookie, we increment both pointers, otherwise we
only increment the cookie pointer. We finally return the number of children that
were satisfied - which is the pointer to the child.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
          s.sort()
          g.sort()
          m, n = len(s), len(g)
          i = j = 0

          while i < m and j < n:
              if s[i] >= g[j]:
                  j += 1

              i += 1

          return j
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n _ log(n) + m _ log(m)) - We sort both the children and the cookies.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n + m) - The sort method in Python uses n space.
