<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/">881. Boats to Save
People</a>

This problem would be knapsack-esque if we could have more than 2 people per
boat. Fortunately, we're only allowed to put 2 people on a boat at a time, so it
makes it way easier to take the greedy approach.

Since we're only allowed to place 2 people on the boat at a time and not bus the
limit, we might as well put the heaviest and the lightest people on the boat, if
they'll fit. We sort the list and maintain 2 pointers, l and r. If the boat can
support the lightest person on the left of the array plus the heaviest person,
we increment l. By default, we always decrement r, the heaviest person will
always be placed on the boat. We update the number of boats, and continue to do
this until l and r meet.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
          people.sort()
          l, r, ans = 0, len(people) - 1, 0

          while l <= r:
              if people[l] + people[r] <= limit:
                  l += 1

              r -= 1
              ans += 1

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n log(n)) - Sorting takes O(n log(n)) time.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We use constant space.
