2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers</a>

Similar to our greedy children with cookies problem, we have players that need
trainers, it's a 1:1 matching. Once a pair is created, we can't reuse those
elements. The simplest solution involves pairing the lowest skilled players with
the lowest skilled trainers first. We sort both inputs and iterate across both
lists using two pointers. If a match is made between a player and a trainer, we
increment the result and move both pointers. If a match can't be made, we move
the trainer pointer to the right. We continue this process until we've iterated
through all the players.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def matchPlayersAndTrainers(self, players: List[int], trainers: List[int]) -> int:
          players.sort()
          trainers.sort()
          m, n = len(players), len(trainers)
          ans = i = j = 0

          while i < m and j < n:
              if players[i] <= trainers[j]:
                  i += 1
                  ans += 1

              j += 1

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n _ log(n) + m _ log(m)) - We sort both lists.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n + m) - Sorting in Python requires n space.
