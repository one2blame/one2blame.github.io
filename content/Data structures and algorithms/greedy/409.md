<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/">409. Longest
Palindrome</a>

Given a string of characters, fine the length of the longest palindrome that we
can construct. Pretty straightforward, just count the frequency of all the
characters. Iterate through all frequencies and divide the frequency by 2 and
multiply by 2. This let's us know how many pairs of characters exist for that
frequency, and lets us know how many characters in total.

If the answer is even, and the frequency of the current character is odd, we can
add 1 to the answer, this will be the middle of the palindrome.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import Counter

```python
  class Solution:
      def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
          ans = 0

          for v in Counter(s).values():
              ans += v // 2 * 2

              if ans % 2 == 0 and v % 2 == 1:
                  ans += 1

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We count the frequency of all characters and iterate through the
frequency distribution.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the frequencies of all the characters.
