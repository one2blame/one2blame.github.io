<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/">502. IPO</a>

We're trying to maximize LeetCode's capital so they can vie for an IPO. We've
got a list of profits with correlating capital it costs to undertake a project
to receive said profit. Given k moves, what's the maximum amount of capital we
can accumulate?

This is a greedy problem, so first we'll have to couple the capital expenses and
the profits, and sort them by capital. As we complete projects, the amount we
have in capital unlocks new projects, so we'll have to use a pointer to our
array to keep track of our frontier. For the projects that are available to use,
we'll use a max heap to select the most profitable one.

For k moves, we adjust our frontier to determine the list of our available
projects based on capital. For each project in the frontier, we push it into the
max heap. We then pop from the max heap and add the profit to our capital. If
the heap is empty, we break the loop.

The solution is as follows:

from heapq import heappush, heappop

```python
  class Solution:
      def findMaximizedCapital(self, k: int, w: int, profits: List[int], capital: List[int]) -> int:
          heap, projects = [], list(zip(capital, profits))
          projects.sort()
          n, avail = len(projects), 0

          for _ in range(k):
              while avail < n and w >= projects[avail][0]:
                  heappush(heap, -projects[avail][1])
                  avail += 1

              if not heap:
                  return w

              w += -heappop(heap)

          return w
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n log(n)) - We have to sort the array.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We use a heap to store the projects.
