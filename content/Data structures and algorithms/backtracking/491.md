491. Non-decreasing Subsequences</a>

We're given a list of integers, nums, and we're asked to create another list of
all the possible non-decreasing subsequences, meaning sequence[i] <= sequence[i

- 1] for some index, i.

We use backtracking to solve this problem, treating each choice we make to
construct the subsequence as a node in graph. For each decision, we'll make sure
to only consider integers succeeding our current index. We'll also only consider
visiting nodes such that our current node's value is less than or equal to the
next node.

Whenever we encounter a subsequence greater than 1 and it's not in our current
answer array, we add it to the result. If we have a subsequence in size equal to
the original array, we return immediately as we're at the end of our path.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def findSubsequences(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
          ans, n = set(), len(nums)

          def backtrack(s: List[int], t: int, i: int) -> None:
              if t > 1 and tuple(s) not in ans:
                  ans.add(tuple(s))

              if t == n:
                  return

              for j in range(i, n):
                  if t > 0 and s[-1] > nums[j]:
                      continue

                  s.append(nums[j])
                  backtrack(s, t + 1, j + 1)
                  s.pop()

          backtrack([], 0, 0)

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(2^n \* n) - Where n is the length of nums.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(2^n \* n) - Our recursion stack can reach length n.
