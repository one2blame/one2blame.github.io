967. Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences</a>

We're asked to find all combinations of numbers with length n where each
consecutive number has a difference of k.

Another backtracking problem, think of the combinations as nodes on a graph.
We're essentially conducting DFS, starting from a node like [1,0,0] and
providing the next index to start searching from the subsequent calls to
backtrack().

At each step in the search, we're checking our neighbor nodes from range 0 - 9
to see if the difference between the current node and the next node have an
absolute value of k. If so, we visit the next node.

If the size of our combination reaches n, we append it to the answer list.
Eventually we traverse all paths of our graphs and find all combinations that
satisfy our constraints.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def numsSameConsecDiff(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
          s, ans = [0] * n, []

          def backtrack(t: List[int], j: int) -> None:
              if j == n:
                  ans.append(int("".join(map(str, t))))
                  return

              for l in range(10):
                  if abs(t[j - 1] - l) == k:
                      t[j] = l
                      backtrack(t, j + 1)

          for i in range(1, 10):
              s[0] = i
              backtrack(s, 1)

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(2^n) - Where n is the desired length of the combinations.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(2^n) - The size of the recursion stack.
