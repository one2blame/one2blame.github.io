<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/">78. Subsets</a>

We're given a list of nums and asked to generate all subsets of the input, maintaining the order of
the integers in the input. The subsets can be returned in any order, but the integers in each subset
must remain in the original order.

We use backtracking to solve this, treating each subset as a node in a graph. We pass the index to
start iteration through nums during each backtrack() function call. This enables us to decrease the
amount of input we're traversing at each node in the graph. This also maintains the original order
of the input. No need to check the size of the subset, we add all of them as we create the final
subset when traversing the graph.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans, n = [], len(nums)

        def backtrack(s: List[int], i: int) -> None:
            ans.append(s[:])

            for j in range(i, n):
                s.append(nums[j])
                backtrack(s, j + 1)
                s.pop()

        backtrack([], 0)

        return ans


_ Time Complexity:

  O(n * 2^n) - Where n is the length of nums, we have to generate all subsets and then copy them
  into the output list.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(n) - We use this much space to store s, the working list for each subset.
