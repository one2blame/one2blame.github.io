<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/">216. Combination
Sum III</a>

We're asked to find all combinations of size k where the sum is equal to n, and
we can't duplicate numbers.

Using backtracking, we keep track of the number of numbers we've selected so
far, the running sum, and the running combination. For numbers in range 1 to 9,
while we have less numbers than k - 1, we select numbers where the running
total + the currently selected number is less than n. We pass on to the next
iteration the next number in the range 1 to 9 - iteration while commence from
there. We also update the size and running total.

Once we're at size of chosen numbers == k - 1, there's only one number in the
range that will complete the combination, so we select the first one that sums
with our running total to n, add it to our answer, and immediately return.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum3(self, k: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = []

        def backtrack(s: List[int], i: int, t: int, u: int) -> None:
            for j in range(i, 10):
                if u < k - 1 and t + j <= n:
                    s.append(j)
                    backtrack(s, j + 1, t + j, u + 1)
                    s.pop()
                elif t + j == n:
                    s.append(j)
                    ans.append(s[:])
                    s.pop()
                    return

        backtrack([], 1, 0, 0)

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O((9! \* k) / (9 - k)!) - Where k is the required size of the combination we're
asked to create.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(k) - Where k is the size of the combination we're asked to create.
