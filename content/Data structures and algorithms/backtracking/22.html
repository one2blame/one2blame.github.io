<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/">22. Generate Parentheses</a>

Given n, we're asked to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses. This means that all
opening parenthesis, (, have an accompanying closing one, ) - no half-open pairs are allowed.

This is a classic backtracking problem, but the easiest way to reason about it would be to draw a
diagram, graphing out the selections we can make at each step to show the combinations we can
create.

From this, we discover that we'll always start with an opening parenthesis, (, and that we only
traverse paths where the number of open parentheses, (, is less than or equal to n. We also discover
the we never start with a closed parenthesis, ), and we always traverse paths where the number of
closed parenthesis, ), is less than or equal to the number of open parentheses.

During our backtracking of this graph, whenever the sum of open and closed parentheses is equal to
n * 2, we add the combination to our answer array and terminate traversal.

The solution is as follows:


  class Solution:
      def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
          ans = []

          def backtrack(s: List[str], l: int, r: int) -> None:
              if l + r == n * 2:
                  ans.append("".join(s))

              if l < n:
                  s.append("(")
                  backtrack(s, l + 1, r)
                  s.pop()

              if r < l:
                  s.append(")")
                  backtrack(s, l, r + 1)
                  s.pop()

          backtrack([], 0, 0)

          return ans


_ Time Complexity:

  O(4^n / sqrt(n)) - Where n is the number of parentheses pairs.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(n) - The recursion stack will have at most n frames.
