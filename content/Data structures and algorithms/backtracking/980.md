<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-iii/">980. Unique Paths
III</a>

Fun problem, I LOVE GRAPHS. We're given a grid, size m \* n, where each cell has
a number that represents something. Our start point is grid[i][j] == 1, and our
end point is grid[i][j] == 2. We have empty cells that we can walk over where
grid[i][j] == 0, and obstacles where grid[i][j] == -1.

We're asked to find all paths to the end that touch all empty grid locations
exactly once. This is easily recognizable as a backtracking problem with DFS,
however, we can't use the iterative version of DFS because we need to maintain a
separate context for the seen set as we visit each path.

We start off by gathering information, finding the start and end points, as well
as counting the number of empty cells. We the start our backtracking from the
start point, already having it marked as seen so we don't revisit it. At each
node in the graph, we check our neighbors to see if they're valid. If so, we
attempt to visit them.

Before visiting a neighbor, we check to see if it's the end. If it is, we check
to see if we visited all the empty cells we counted. If we haven't yet, we skip
visiting the end. Otherwise, we visit the end and increment our answer.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsIII(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        start, end = (0, 0), (m - 1, n - 1)
        empties = self.ans = 0

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 0:
                    empties += 1
                elif grid[i][j] == 1:
                    start = (i, j)
                elif grid[i][j] == 2:
                    end = (i, j)

        def valid(i: int, j: int) -> bool:
            return -1 < i < m and -1 < j < n and grid[i][j] != -1

        def backtrack(node: tuple, seen: set, c: int) -> None:
            y, x = node

            if (y, x) == end:
                self.ans += 1
                return

            for dy, dx in directions:
                ny, nx = y + dy, x + dx

                if valid(ny, nx) and (ny, nx) not in seen:
                    if (ny, nx) == end and c != empties:
                        continue

                    seen.add((ny, nx))
                    backtrack((ny, nx), seen, c + 1)
                    seen.remove((ny, nx))

        backtrack(start, {start}, 0)

        return self.ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(3^n) - Where n is the number of empty cells, we make at most 3 recursive calls
at each node.

\_ Space Complexity:

O((m _ n) + n) - We store at most m _ n nodes in our seen set, and n is the
number of empty cells.
