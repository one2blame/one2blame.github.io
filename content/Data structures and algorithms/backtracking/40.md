<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/">40. Combination Sum
II</a>

Given a list of candidates and a target, target, we're asked to return all
combinations of the input that sum to that target, without duplicates.

Sorting the input helps us avoid creating duplicate combinations as we can avoid
traversing paths with the same starting number. We maintain a running total used
to determine if we should select a path after checking the sum of the current
number against the running total - if it's less than the target we traverse the
path.

Once the sum of the combination is equal to the target, we append it to our
answer list and terminate.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import Counter

```python
  class Solution:
      def combinationSum2(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
          ans, n = [], len(candidates)
          candidates.sort()

          def backtrack(s: List[int], i: int, t: int) -> None:
              if t == target:
                  ans.append(s[:])
                  return

              for j in range(i, n):
                  if j > i and candidates[j] == candidates[j - 1]:
                      continue

                  if candidates[j] + t <= target:
                      s.append(candidates[j])
                      backtrack(s, j + 1, t + candidates[j])
                      s.pop()
                  else:
                      return

          backtrack([], 0, 0)

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(2^n) - We create all possible combinations from the input array in the worst
case.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Where n is the size of the input, this is our recursion stack.
