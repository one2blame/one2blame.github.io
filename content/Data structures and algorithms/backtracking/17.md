17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number</a>

We're given a string, digits, containing a phone number. We're asked to return
all possible letter combinations that the number could represent if typed into a
phone. To solve this, we use backtracking to create all possible combinations.

First things first, we create a mapping of digits to letters - this will help us
lookup the letters in constant time for a particular digit. Then, we backtrack
like always - if the length of our combination is equal to the size of the
digits, we append the combination to the answer list. For each character mapped
to our current digit, denoted by index i that we maintain, we append the
character to the combination and recursively call the backtrack function for the
next digit to handle, incrementing the index by 1. Once the recursion is done,
we pop the character from the working combination and move to the next one.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
          mapping = {
              "2": "abc",
              "3": "def",
              "4": "ghi",
              "5": "jkl",
              "6": "mno",
              "7": "pqrs",
              "8": "tuv",
              "9": "wxyz",
          }

          n, ans = len(digits), []

          if not n:
              return ans

          def backtrack(s: List[str], i: int) -> None:
              if i == n:
                  ans.append("".join(s))
                  return

              for c in mapping[digits[i]]:
                  s.append(c)
                  backtrack(s, i + 1)
                  s.pop()

          backtrack([], 0)

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* 4^n) - We have 4 possible characters for each digit, and we have n
digits. Also, joining the combination to append to the answer list takes O(n)
time.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - The recursion stack will have at most n frames.
