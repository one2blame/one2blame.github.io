<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/destination-city/">1436. Destination
City</a>

Given a list of paths where paths[0] is the starting city and paths[0] is the
destination city, return the only city that is never a starting city, only a
destination.

To solve this we just use list comprehension to extract the start and
destination cities, placing them each into two seperate sets. Then we use a set
operation to calculate the difference between the destinations and the starts,
returning the only city that is the only destination.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def destCity(self, paths: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        starts = set([start for start, _ in paths])
        destinations = set([destination for _, destination in paths])
        return list(destinations - starts)[0]
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We parse all paths.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We create two sets of starts and destinations.
