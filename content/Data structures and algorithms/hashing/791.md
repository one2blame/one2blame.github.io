<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/">791. Custom Sort
String</a>

We're given a string of characters representing the order in which our input
string, s, should conform to. All existing characters matching a character in
the order string must be placed in the same order as the order string. The rest
of the characters can be placed in any order.

To solve this, we count the occurrences of each character in the input string.
We create a list to store our result. We iterate over the order string and if
the character currently being inspected matches a character in the input string,
we append the character to our result - multiplying the operation by the counter
of the character in the input string.

We wrap up our solution by appending the remaining character not found in the
order string.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import defaultdict, Counter

```python
  class Solution:
      def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
          s_count = Counter(s)
          ans = []

          for c in order:
              if c in s_count:
                  ans += [c] * s_count[c]
                  del s_count[c]

          for c, count in s_count.items():
              ans += [c] * count

          return "".join(ans)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through all characters in the input.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - All inputs consist of lowercase English letters, so the space complexity
is constant.
