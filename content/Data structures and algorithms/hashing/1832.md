1832. Check if the Sentence Is Pangram</a>

Not really a serious question, to be honest. A pangram is a sentence where every
letter of the English alphabet appears at least once. We know the English
alphabet has 26 letters, so we just declare the input string as a set and check
to see if the length of the set is 26.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def checkIfPangram(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
          return len(set(sentence)) == 26
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(1) - We know the English alphabet has 26 letters, so we know the set will have
at most 26.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - The input string only consists of alphabet letters, so the set will have
at most 26.
