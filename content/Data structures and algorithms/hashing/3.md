3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters</a>

Sliding window question using a dictionary to keep the last time we've seen a
specific character. We need to maximize for the longest substring we can find
without repeating characters. We can track the last time we've seen a character
by maintaining a dictionary of the characters each time we encounter them, and
record the current pointer (right) of our two pointers, left and right, making
sure to add +1 to the right pointer (because we want to skip past the repeated
character).

The left pointer will be the maximum of its current value vs the index of the
last time we've seen a specific character. Why the maximum? Well it's possible
we see another character repeated from the past that has a lower index than the
current index of the left pointer. There's no point in going backwards because
in that case we've already found another repeating character later in the list.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import defaultdict

```python
  class Solution:
      def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
          seen = defaultdict(int)
          l = ans = 0

          for r, char in enumerate(s):
              if char in seen:
                  l = max(seen[char], l)

              ans = max(ans, r - l + 1)
              seen[char] = r + 1

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the string once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the last time we've seen each character in a dictionary.
