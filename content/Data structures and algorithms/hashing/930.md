<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/">930. Binary
Subarrays With Sum</a>

We've got an array of 1s and 0s, and we need to find all the subarrays that sum
to the goal provided. One would think a sliding window approach would work, but
actually we want to use a prefix sum. We keep track of the current sum of the
numbers we've seen, and index into a dictionary that keeps track of the number
of times we've seen a particular sum. We add to the answer the number of times
we've seen the current sum minus the goal - providing us with a number of
subarrays that match that constraint.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import defaultdict

```python
  class Solution:
      def numSubarraysWithSum(self, nums: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
          prefix = defaultdict(int)
          prefix[0] = 1
          ans = curr = 0

          for num in nums:
              curr += num
              ans += prefix[curr - goal]
              prefix[curr] += 1

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the input once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a dictionary of prefix sums.
