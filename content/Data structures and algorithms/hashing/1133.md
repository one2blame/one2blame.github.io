<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-unique-number/">1133. Largest
Unique Number</a>

Pretty straightforward question. Given an array of integers, find the greatest
number that only occurs once. The optimal solution involves using the Counter
class from the Python collections library.

Once we counted all the occurrences of each number in the input array, we
iterate through the dictionary and filter out numbers that have an occurrence
count greater than 1. We do this by only inspecting numbers whose occurrence
count == 1 - from there we use max() to store the larget number in the answer
variable.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import Counter

```python
  class Solution:
      def largestUniqueNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          seen = Counter(nums)
          ans = -1

          for num, count in seen.items():
              if count == 1:
                  ans = max(ans, num)

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We count all occurrences of each number in the input array.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store all occurrences of each number in the input array in a
dictionary.
