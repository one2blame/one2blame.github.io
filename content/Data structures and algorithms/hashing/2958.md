<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-subarray-with-at-most-k-frequency/">
2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency</a>

This is somewhat related to <a href="3.html">3. Longest Substring Without
Repeating Characters</a>, however, we are now looking for the longest subarray
with at most k frequency of any number.

Just like our related problem, we maintain a hashmap to keep track of the
numbers we've seen, but this time we take action to shrink the window when the
frequency of a number is greater than k. Instead of the left pointer jumping to
the last seen location of the number in question, we have to gradually shrink
the array because the number in question has been seen multiple times.

So to solve this, while the left pointer is less than the right pointer and the
number in question is still larger than k, we decrement the frequency of the
number pointed to by the left pointer and increment the left pointer.
Eventually, the number in question will no longer have a frequency greater than
k.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maxSubarrayLength(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        count = defaultdict(int)
        ans = l = 0

        for r, num in enumerate(nums):
            count[num] += 1

            if count[num] > k:
                while l < r and count[num] > k:
                    count[nums[l]] -= 1
                    l += 1

            ans = max(ans, r - l + 1)

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We have to iterate through the entire input array.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the frequency of each number in the input array.
