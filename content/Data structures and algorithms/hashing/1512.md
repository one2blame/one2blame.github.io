<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-pairs/">1512. Number of
Good Pairs</a>

A good pair is a good pair if some indices i and j satisfy the condition nums[i]
== nums[j] and i < j. We're asked to return the number of good pairs in the
input array.

We can simply do this by maintaining a dictionary to keep track of the number of
occurrences of each integer. When we iterate through the list of numbers, we
look to see if we've already encountered this integer. If so, we add the current
count to the answer and then increment the count.

This is because, if we've already seen the number, then we know that this
current number would be a good pair with all the previous occurrences of the
number. The dictionary inherently keeps track of the number of good pairs we've
seen so far.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import defaultdict

```python
  class Solution:
      def numIdenticalPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          counts = defaultdict(int)
          ans = 0

          for num in nums:
              ans += counts[num]
              counts[num] += 1

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the input string once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a running count for each integer encountered in the input
list.
