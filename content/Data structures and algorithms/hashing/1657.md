1657. Determine if Two Strings are Close</a>

We have two strings. We need to know if we can create one string from the other
by replacing characters. The characters within the first string need to exist in
the second string. If we were to replace characters, they should have the same
frequency in both strings.

First we check to see if the strings are the same length. Then we check to see
if the characters in both strings are the same. Finally, we count the frequency
of the characters, sort the frequencies, and verify that they match.

Because we only deal with lowercase letters, our storage is O(1) and our time
complexity is O(n). Usually sorting is O(n log n), but because we only have 26
characters, we can consider it O(1). Therefore, we only incur an O(n) time
complexity because of the counting.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import Counter

```python
  class Solution:
      def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
          if len(word1) != len(word2): return False
          if set(word1) != set(word2): return False
          word1_count = Counter(word1)
          word2_count = Counter(word2)
          return sorted(word1_count.values()) == sorted(word2_count.values())
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We count the frequency of all the characters in the input, and conduct a
sort with a time complexity of O(26 log 26).

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - All inputs consist of lowercase English letters, so the space complexity
is constant.
