<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/path-crossing/">1496. Path Crossing</a>

Pretty straightforward, just requires a little extra work in setting up the
processing of the input. We're asked to detemine if a path specification from an
input string ends up causing us to cross paths on a 2D plane. We're given
instructions to use NSEW as our directions, correlating to up, down, left, and
right.

Best and easiest way to solve this is to start at the origin (0, 0), adding this
tuple to set since tuples are hashable. Then we iterate through the path string,
keeping track of our current location. If the updated location after taking
instructions from the path causes us to return to a location previously visited,
we return True - we crossed our own path. Otherwise, we add the current location
to the visited set.

We continue to do this until we iterate through the entire path. Then we return
False.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def isPathCrossing(self, path: str) -> bool:
        curr = [0, 0]
        visited = set()
        visited.add(tuple(curr))

        for direction in path:
            if direction == "N": curr[1] += 1
            elif direction == "S": curr[1] -= 1
            elif direction == "E": curr[0] += 1
            elif direction == "W": curr[0] -= 1
            if tuple(curr) in visited: return True
            visited.add(tuple(curr))

        return False
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the path string once, where n is the length of the
path string.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the visited locations in a set, where n is the length of the
path string.
