<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/">
1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays</a>

This problem is very similar to <a href="560.html">560</a>. Instead of finding
the number of subarrays that sum to k, we're finding the number of subarrays
that have at most k odd numbers. We simply change the increment of the curr
variable to the isOdd constraint, num % 2.

The logic is still the same. The count dictionary maintains the last seen prefix
sum that defines the beginning of a subarray that satisfies our constraint. We
add the value of count[curr - k] to the result, and mark the current prefix sum
as seen.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        count = defaultdict(int)
        ans = curr = 0
        count[0] = 1

        for num in nums:
            curr += num % 2
            ans += count[curr - k]
            count[curr] += 1

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the interger list once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store at most n values in the dictionary.
