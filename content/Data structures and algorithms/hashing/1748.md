<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-unique-elements/">1748. Sum of
Unique Elements</a>

Given an array of integers, only sum the ones that appear once. Use a Counter
from the collections module to count occurrences. Use list comprehension to
retain unique numbers - sum the list.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import Counter

```python
  class Solution:
      def sumOfUnique(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          counts = Counter(nums)
          return sum([num for num in counts if counts[num] < 2])
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through the array to count all the integers.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the count of each interger.
