2248. Intersection of Multiple Arrays</a>

Fun one. We've got a 2D array of integers, for each array the integers are
distinct and non-empty. We want to find the intersection of all the arrays, the
integers that are present in each array in this 2D array. Finally, we want the
answer to be sorted.

Since the intersection exists in every array, we can use the first array to
create a filter, using the values contained within as a set. We iterate through
the remaining arrays conducting an AND operation, essentially finding the
intersection between the filter and the current array under inspection.

We update the filter with the result of the AND operation, and this essentially
becomes our answer. Finally, we sort the filter, cast it to a list, and return
it.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if len(nums) == 1: return sorted(nums[0])
        ans = set(nums[0])
        for arr in nums[1::]: ans &= set(arr)
        return sorted(list(ans))
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* m) - This is the worst case time complexity - if every element in the
input is unique.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(m) - This is the worst case space complexity - if every element in the input
is unique.
