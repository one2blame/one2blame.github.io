<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/">49. Group Anagrams</a>

More interesting hashing example. Basically we have a list of strings, return a
list of lists that groups strings based on whether or not they are anagrams of
each other.

The most inefficient way to do this would be to compare each string to every
other string, this will end up with a time complexity of O(n^2 \* m) -
definitely not optimal.

We've got two ways to solve this in a faster time. We can create a dictionary
where the keys are sorted versions of the input strings - effectively creating a
hash for an anagram-able string. We would have to sort every string provided to
us in the list, and then were can find its home in the dictionary. This would
give us a time complexity of O(n \* mlogm).

The cooler way to solve this is to create a dictionary where the keys are a
tuple with the count of each character in the string. This would give us a time
complexity of O(n \* m).

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
          ans = collections.defaultdict(list)
          for s in strs:
              count = [0] * 26
              for c in s:
                  count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
              ans[tuple(count)].append(s)
          return ans.values()
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* m) - We iterate through each string in the input list and count the
occurrences of each character in the string.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n \* m) - We store a list of lists of strings in the answer variable.
