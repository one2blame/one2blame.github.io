<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/">383. Ransom Note</a>

Super easy question. Given a ransome note string and a magazine string,
determine if the ransom note can be constructed from the provided magazine. To
solve this, we just count the characters' occurrences in the ransom note and
compare them to the characters' occurrences in the magazine. If the occurrences
of characters in the ransom note are less than or equal to the magazine's, we
verify that the ransom note can be constructed from the magazine.

The Python Counter class from the collections library is super useful for this
task.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import Counter

```python
  class Solution:
      def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
          return Counter(ransomNote) <= Counter(magazine)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(max(n, m)) - We count every character in the ransom note and magazine strings.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We store the count of every character in the ransom note and magazine
strings in a dictionary, however, the dictionary will have at most 26
characters, so the space complexity is constant.
