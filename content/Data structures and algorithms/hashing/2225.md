2225. Find Plays With Zero or One Losses</a>

This is a regular counting problem. We have a list of matches of type
[[int, int], ..., [int, int]] where match[0] is the winner and match[1] is the
loser. The problem asks us to return a sorted list of winners (players who have
0 losses) and losers (players who have at most 1 loss).

We solve this problem by using defaultdict(int) to create a dictionary of losers
and their losses. We also maintain a set() of players just to track what players
have actually played a match.

We iterate through all matches, adding both the winners and the losers to the
players set. We also add the loser to the losses dictionary, incrementing their
loss by 1. Finally, we use a set operation with the players set to find players
that are not in the losses dictionary. These are our winners.

For each loser and number of losses, if the number of losses for a loser == 1,
we add them to the losers list. Finally, we return a sorted list of winners and
losers.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import defaultdict

```python
  class Solution:
      def findWinners(self, matches: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
          counts = defaultdict(int)
          players = set()

          for winner, loser in matches:
              players.add(winner)
              players.add(loser)
              counts[loser] += 1

          winners = players - set(counts.keys())
          losers = []

          for loser, losses in counts.items():
              if losses == 1: losers += [loser]

          return [sorted(list(winners)), sorted(losers)]
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through each match in the input list once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store every player in the players set.
