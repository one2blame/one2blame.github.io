<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-vertices-to-reach-all-nodes/">
1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes</a>

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we're asked to find the minimum set of
vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. We can do this by
finding all nodes that have no incoming edges.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def findSmallestSetOfVertices(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        indegrees = [0] * n
        for _, y in edges:
            indegrees[y] += 1

        return [i for i, indegree in enumerate(indegrees) if indegree == 0]
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(m) - We iterate through the edges to count the indegrees.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We track the indegrees of each node.
