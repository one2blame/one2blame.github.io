<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/">100. Same Tree</a>

We have the root of two binary trees, p and q. We have to determine if these two
binary trees are the same. We do this by using depth-first search to traverse
both trees simultaneously. We compare each node at each step of the search. If
the nodes are not equal, we return False. If we reach the end of the search and
all nodes are equal, we return True.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
          stack = [(p, q)]

          while stack:
              p, q = stack.pop()

              if not p and not q:
                  continue

              if not q or not p:
                  return False

              if p.val != q.val:
                  return False

              stack.append((p.right, q.right))
              stack.append((p.left, q.left))

          return True
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of nodes to explore.
