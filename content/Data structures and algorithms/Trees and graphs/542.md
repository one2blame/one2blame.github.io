<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/">542. 01 Matrix</a>

For each 1 in a n x m matrix, we need to return the distance of the nearest 0.
The fastest way to solve this is to conduct a BFS from each 0 in the matrix. If
we've already seen a 0, and the surrounding cells are also 0 or have already
been seen, then we skip over the cell. As we expand out from 1s, we keep track
of the distance from the nearest 0. This is updated on the execution of each
step.

We maintain the solution in the same matrix we were provided, updating the
values of the cells as we conduct BFS from each 0, outward.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(mat)
        m = len(mat[0])

        def is_valid(row: int, col: int) -> bool:
            return -1 < row < n and -1 < col < m and mat[row][col] == 1

        queue = []
        seen = set()

        for row in range(n):
            for col in range(m):
                if mat[row][col] == 0:
                    seen.add((row, col))
                    queue.append((row, col, 1))

        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

        while queue:
            curr_queue, queue = queue, []

            for row, col, steps in curr_queue:
                for dy, dx in directions:
                    nrow, ncol = row + dy, col + dx

                    if (nrow, ncol) not in seen and is_valid(nrow, ncol):
                        seen.add((nrow, ncol))
                        mat[nrow][ncol] = steps
                        queue.append((nrow, ncol, steps + 1))

        return mat
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* m) - We visit each cell.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n \* m) - We maintain the answer in the 2D matrix.
