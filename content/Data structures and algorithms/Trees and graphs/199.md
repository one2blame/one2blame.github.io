199. Binary Tree Right Side View</a>

Given the root of a binary tree, we're asked to return a list of values from
ndoes on the "right side" of the tree. Imagine if you're viewing the tree in 3D
space from the right side, these are the only nodes you will be able to see.

In order to solve this problem, we used breadth-first search to traverse the
tree level by level. The "right side" node at each level will be the last
element in the queue for that particular level of breadth-first search.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  from collections import deque

  class Solution:
      def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
          if not root:
              return []

          ans, queue = [], deque([root])

          while queue:
              curr_queue, queue = queue, deque()

              while curr_queue:
                  node = curr_queue.popleft()

                  if node.left:
                      queue.append(node.left)
                  if node.right:
                      queue.append(node.right)

              ans.append(node.val)

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain queues that can grow to the size of the number of nodes in
the tree.
