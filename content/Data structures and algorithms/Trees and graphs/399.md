<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/">399. Evaluate
Division</a>

Super tricky question - really only solvable if you realize this is supposed to
be a graph / DFS problem. We're given a list of equations, these just being a
list of pairs of characters - each character should be treated as a node and
each pairing should be treated as an edge. We're given a list of values
correlating to each edge, this is the quotient for the two nodes during
division. This should be considered the weight of each edge. Finally, we're
given a list of queries, two nodes and we're asked to return an answer list that
resolves the quotient for each query.

Treating each pairs as an edge, we reconstruct the graph with weighted edges.
For a particular dictionary spot in the graph, referencing a node, we'll have
another dictionary mapping the denominator and the value of the edge (quotient).
For each query, we conduct a DFS with the start and end nodes, multiplying the
quotients of each edge as we go. If we reach the end node, we return the product
of the quotients. If we don't, we return -1.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def calcEquation(
        self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]
    ) -> List[float]:
        def answer_query(start, end):
            if start not in graph:
                return -1

            seen = {start}
            stack = [(start, 1)]

            while stack:
                node, ratio = stack.pop()
                if node == end:
                    return ratio

                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if neighbor not in seen:
                        seen.add(neighbor)
                        stack.append((neighbor, ratio * graph[node][neighbor]))

            return -1

        graph = defaultdict(dict)
        for i in range(len(equations)):
            numerator, denominator = equations[i]
            val = values[i]
            graph[numerator][denominator] = val
            graph[denominator][numerator] = 1 / val

        ans = []
        for numerator, denominator in queries:
            ans.append(answer_query(numerator, denominator))

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* m) - Where n is the number of equations and m is the number of queries.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Where n is the number of equations.
