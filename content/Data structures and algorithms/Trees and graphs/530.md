530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST</a>

We're given a binary search tree and we're asked to find the minimum absolute
difference between any two nodes in the tree. Known trick - if we traverse the
binary search tree with depth-first search in order, meaning we do our operation
between visiting the left and right node for any given node, we will access node
values in sorted order.

Knowing this, we maintain a global answer for the minimum difference and a
global variable for the last visited node. We then traverse the tree in order,
we update the global minimum difference with the current node less the previous
node.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def getMinimumDifference(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
          self.ans = float("inf")
          self.prev = None

          def dfs(node: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
              if not node:
                  return

              dfs(node.left)
              if self.prev:
                  self.ans = min(self.ans, node.val - self.prev.val)
              self.prev = node
              dfs(node.right)

          dfs(root)
          return self.ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary search tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Our recursive call stack can reach O(n).
