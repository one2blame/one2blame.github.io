<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/">841. Keys and Rooms</a>

Pretty simple depth-first search problem. We're asked to determine if we're able
to travel to every room from room 0. In each room, we're given a list of keys
that allow us to open other rooms. This list of keys can be treated like a list
of neighbors for the current room.

Each time we visit a room, we mark it as seen or visited. At the end of the DFS
from the 0th node, if all rooms are marked as seen we return True, otherwise
False.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
          seen = [False] * len(rooms)
          seen[0] = True
          stack = [0]

          while stack:
              node = stack.pop()
              for neighbor in rooms[node]:
                  if not seen[neighbor]:
                      seen[neighbor] = True
                      stack.append(neighbor)

          return all(seen)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n + e) - Where n is the number of rooms and e is the number of keys.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the stack and a set of seen rooms.
