<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/">938. Range Sum of
BST</a>

We're given the root of a binary search tree and two integers, high and low.
We're asked to find the sum of all nodes in the binary search tree that are in
the range [low, high], inclusive.

To solve this, we use depth-first search. At each node, we check to see if its
value is in the inclusive [low, high] range. If so, we add its value to the answer.
If the node is greater than low, we know that more nodes on the left subtree of the
current node can possibly be in the range, so we add the left node to the stack.
Similarly, if the node is less than high, we know that nodes on the right subtree
are possibly in range - so we add the right node to the stack.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def rangeSumBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], low: int, high: int) -> int:
          ans = 0
          if not root:
              return ans
          stack = [root]

          while stack:
              node = stack.pop()

              if low <= node.val and node.val <= high:
                  ans += node.val

              if low < node.val:
                  if node.left:
                      stack.append(node.left)

              if node.val < high:
                  if node.right:
                      stack.append(node.right)

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary search tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of nodes to visit.
