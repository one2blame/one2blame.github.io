<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/">200. Number of
Islands</a>

We're asked to determine the number of islands in a 2D matrix of "1"s and "0"s.
"1"s represent land, and islands are adjacent "1"s in the directions up, down,
left, and right. This question essentially asks us to find the connected
components for the nodes represented by "1"s in this 2D matrix. Nodes are
connected if adjacent nodes are "1"s as well.

To solve this connectivity problem, we use Union-Find again. We maintain a
parent and rank array in the Union-Find class, doing a little extra work to
create a hash map that we can index into with our custom hashing function:

i \* m + j

where i and j are the row and column indices, and m is the number of columns in
the 2D matrix.

When evaluating each node in the 2D matrix, we check to see if the current i, j
matrix location contains a "1". If so, we mark the location as seen by changing
the value to "0". We then check all adjacent locations to see if they're valid
nodes containing a "1". If these adjacent locations are connected to the current
node, we merge their sets together.

Each time we execute union_set, we decrement the number of islands by 1. This is
because we're merging connected components together, and the number of connected
components is the number of islands.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import defaultdict

class UnionFind: def **init**(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> None: self.count =
0 n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0]) self.parent, self.rank = [0 for \_ in range(n

- m)], [0 for _ in range(n * m)]

          for i in range(n):
              for j in range(m):
                  if grid[i][j] == "1":
                      self.parent[i * m + j] = i * m + j
                      self.count += 1
                  self.rank[i * m + j] = 0

      def find(self, x: int) -> int:
          if self.parent[x] != x:
              self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
          return self.parent[x]

      def union_set(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
          xset, yset = self.find(x), self.find(y)

          if xset != yset:
              if self.rank[xset] < self.rank[yset]:
                  self.parent[xset] = yset
              elif self.rank[yset] < self.rank[xset]:
                  self.parent[yset] = xset
              else:
                  self.parent[yset] = xset
                  self.rank[xset] += 1

              self.count -= 1

      def get_count(self) -> int:
          return self.count

```python
  class Solution:
      def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
          n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
          dsu = UnionFind(grid)

          for i in range(n):
              for j in range(m):
                  if grid[i][j] == "1":
                      grid[i][j] = "0"
                      if i - 1 > -1 and grid[i - 1][j] == "1":
                          dsu.union_set(i * m + j, (i - 1) * m + j)
                      if i + 1 < n and grid[i + 1][j] == "1":
                          dsu.union_set(i * m + j, (i + 1) * m + j)
                      if j - 1 > -1 and grid[i][j - 1] == "1":
                          dsu.union_set(i * m + j, i * m + (j - 1))
                      if j + 1 < m and grid[i][j + 1] == "1":
                          dsu.union_set(i * m + j, i * m + (j + 1))

          return dsu.get_count()
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* m) - We iterate over all values in the 2D matrix.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n \* m) - We maintain the parent and rank arrays.
