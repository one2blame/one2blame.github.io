<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-largest-value-in-each-tree-row/">
515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row</a>

Given the root of a binary tree, we're asked to return the greatest value for
each row of the tree. Naturally, we solve this with breadth-first search, as it
allows us to inspect all nodes at the same depth for each iteration.

We maintain a global array, ans, to store the maximum for each level. We
maintain a queue of nodes to visit at each level. At each level, when we visit a
new node, we record the maximum value between this node and the current maximum
value for this level. After we finish processing the level, the maximum value
encountered is appended to the ans array.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import deque

```python
class Solution:
    def largestValues(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []

        ans, queue = [], deque([root])

        while queue:
            curr_queue, queue = queue, deque()
            greatest = float("-inf")

            while curr_queue:
                node = curr_queue.popleft()
                greatest = max(greatest, node.val)

                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)

                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)

            ans.append(greatest)

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain queues that can grow to the size of the number of nodes in
the tree.
