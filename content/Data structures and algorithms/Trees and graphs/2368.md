2368. Reachable Nodes With Restrictions</a>

Given an undirected graph, we're asked to find how many nodes we can reach from
node 0. Like in <a href="695.html">695. Max Area of Island</a>, we can use
UnionFind to keep track of the size of the connected components each time we
conduct a union_set operation.

Once we've processed all edges, the disjoint sets will be complete. We can then
acquire the rank of the parent of node 0, which will give us the number of nodes
in 0's disjoint set, which is the number of nodes that can be reached from 0.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n: int) -> None:
        self.parent, self.rank = [i for i in range(n)], [1 for _ in range(n)]

    def find(self, x: int) -> int:
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union_set(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
        xset, yset = self.find(x), self.find(y)

        if xset != yset:
            if self.rank[xset] < self.rank[yset]:
                xset, yset = yset, xset

            self.parent[yset] = xset
            self.rank[xset] += self.rank[yset]

    def get_size(self, x: int) -> int:
        return self.rank[self.find(x)]

class Solution:
    def reachableNodes(
        self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], restricted: List[int]
    ) -> int:
        uf = UnionFind(n)
        restricted = set(restricted)

        for u, v in edges:
            if u not in restricted and v not in restricted:
                uf.union_set(u, v)

        return uf.get_size(0)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(m) - We iterate through the edges to perform union_set.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We track the parents and ranks of each node.
