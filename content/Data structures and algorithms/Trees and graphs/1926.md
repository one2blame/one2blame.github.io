1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze</a>

Another fun question. We're given a maze spec in an n x m matrix. Locations with
"." are emtpy spots, locations with "+" have walls. We enter the maze from some
location and are asked to find the shortest path to the exit - this being any
location along the outside of the maze not blocked by a wall.

We solve this problem naturally with BFS. Instead of maintaining a seen set, we
can just mark visited locations with the "+" character. If a location is valid
and also an exit, we return the steps we've travel so far + 1. We do this
immediately because, with BFS, this is guaranteed to be the shortest path.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def nearestExit(self, maze: List[List[str]], entrance: List[int]) -> int:
          n, m = len(maze), len(maze[0])

          def is_valid(row: int, col: int) -> bool:
              return -1 < row < n and -1 < col < m and maze[row][col] == "."

          def is_exit(row: int, col: int) -> bool:
              return row == 0 or row == n - 1 or col == 0 or col == m - 1

          directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
          srow, scol = entrance[0], entrance[1]
          maze[srow][scol] = "+"
          queue = [(srow, scol, 0)]

          while queue:
              curr_queue, queue = queue, []

              for row, col, steps in curr_queue:
                  for dy, dx in directions:
                      nrow, ncol = row + dy, col + dx

                      if is_valid(nrow, ncol):
                          if is_exit(nrow, ncol):
                              return steps + 1

                          maze[nrow][ncol] = "+"
                          queue.append((nrow, ncol, steps + 1))

          return -1
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* m) - n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges - standard BFS
time complexity.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(max(n, m)) - We use constant space to mark visited locations. We use a queue
to store the cells visited.
