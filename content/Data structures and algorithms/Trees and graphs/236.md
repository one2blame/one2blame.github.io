<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/">
236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree</a>

Given the root of a binary tree and two nodes, p and q, we're asked to determine
their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor">lowest
common ancestor</a>. The lowest common ancestor can be either p or q, or some
node in between.

We conduct a depth-first search to search for the two nodes, p and q. If we
encounter either p or q, we return the node. While search, if a particular path
never sees p or q, None will propagate up the tree as we backtrack. Eventually,
we encounter a node where the left and right nodes are not None, meaning that p
and q are on different sides of the tree. This is the lowest common ancestor.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(
        self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode
    ) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return None

        if root == p or root == q:
            return root

        left, right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(
            root.left, p, q
        ), self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        if left and right:
            return root

        if left:
            return left

        return right
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We use recursion, so our call stack is size O(n).
