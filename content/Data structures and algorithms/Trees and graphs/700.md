700. Search in a Binary Search Tree</a>

Given a binary search tree, we have to find the node with the given value and
return its subtree. We can do this iteratively, using DFS but only traversing
nodes following the binary search method.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        while root and root.val != val:
            root = root.left if val < root.val else root.right
        return root
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(h) - Where h is the height of the tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We only maintain one pointer, using constant space.
