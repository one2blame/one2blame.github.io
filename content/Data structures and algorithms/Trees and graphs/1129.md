<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-with-alternating-colors/">
1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors</a>

Fun question! We're given two sets of edges, red and blue, and asked for the
shortest path from 0 to all the other nodes in the graph - if we can reach them.
Otherwise, we return -1 for the length of the shortest path to the unreachable
nodes.

To easily solve this, we'll use BFS. We process the red edges and the blue
edges, placing them in separate graphs. We maintain a seen set that track the
state of the node as well as the color of the edge used to reach the node. We
maintain a queue for each level that tracks the node, the distance so far, and
the color of the edge used to reach the node.

We process the nodes using BFS, maintaining the minimum distance to reach each
node in our answer. For each neighbor of the current node with the next color
edge to traverse, we check to see if this node has already been seen with the
same color. If not, we add it to the seen list, and append it to the queue,
updating the color and distance.

At the end, we post process the answer to remove any float("inf") values and
return the answer.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import defaultdict

```python
  class Solution:
      def shortestAlternatingPaths(
          self, n: int, redEdges: List[List[int]], blueEdges: List[List[int]]
      ) -> List[int]:
          red = 0
          blue = 1

          graph = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(list))

          for a, b in redEdges:
              graph[red][a].append(b)

          for u, v in blueEdges:
              graph[blue][u].append(v)

          ans = [float("inf")] * n
          queue = [(0, red, 0), (0, blue, 0)]
          seen = {(0, red), (0, blue)}

          while queue:
              curr_queue, queue = queue, []

              for node, color, distance in curr_queue:
                  ans[node] = min(ans[node], distance)

                  for neighbor in graph[color][node]:
                      if (neighbor, 1 - color) not in seen:
                          seen.add((neighbor, 1 - color))
                          queue.append((neighbor, 1 - color, distance + 1))

          return [distance if distance != float("inf") else -1 for distance in ans]
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* m) - n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges - standard BFS
time complexity.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n \* m) - We process the nodes and edges and store them in an adjacency list.
