1376. Time Needed to Inform All Employees</a>

We have a company with 0 to n-1 employees, a head honcho defined by headID, a
list of managers, and the time it takes to inform each employee with new info -
informTime. The managers[] list defines the employee : manager relationship at
manager[i] - for the i-th employee their manager is manager[i]. We're asked to
find the time needed to inform all employees.

Well, all employees won't be informed until the last one is informed - so
whichever path in this tree takes the longest. How do we know it's a tree? The
manager[i] list defines directed edges from manager -> subordinate. Given these
variables, we construct a graph of directed edges and then conduct BFS.

As we conduct the BFS, we maintain the longest length of time it takes to inform
all employees on a particular path.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def numOfMinutes(self, n: int, headID: int, manager: List[int], informTime: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        graph = defaultdict(list)

        for i in range(n):
            j = manager[i]

            if j == -1:
                continue

            graph[j].append(i)

        queue = [(headID, informTime[headID])]

        while queue:
            curr_queue, queue = queue, []

            for employee, time in curr_queue:
                ans = max(ans, time)

                for subordinate in graph[employee]:
                    queue.append((subordinate, informTime[subordinate] + time))

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - BFS takes O(n) time to traverse the graph. Constructing the graph takes
O(n) time.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the graph in an adjaceny list. The queue can store up to n
elements.
