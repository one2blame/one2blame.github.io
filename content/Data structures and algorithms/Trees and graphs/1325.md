<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/">
1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value</a>

Given the root of a binary tree, we're asked to delete all the leaves that have
the same value as the target. Tricky - we also have to delete nodes that become
leaves after their children are deleted.

We conduct a DFS to recursively traverse the tree. If the current node has no
children and its value is equal to the target, we return None. This will cause
the parent calling this function to essentially delete its child node. If the
current node has children, we recursively call this function on the left and
right children, storing their return value.

We then double check to see if the left and right children are now delete (==
None). If that's the case, we return None. Otherwise, we return the current
node.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def removeLeafNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
          if not root:
              return None

          if root.val == target and not root.left and not root.right:
              return None

          root.left = self.removeLeafNodes(root.left, target)
          root.right = self.removeLeafNodes(root.right, target)

          if root.val == target and not root.left and not root.right:
              return None

          return root
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse O(n) nodes of the tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(log(n)) - We use O(log(n)) space for the recursive call stack.
