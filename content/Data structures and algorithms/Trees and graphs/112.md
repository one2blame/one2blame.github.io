<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/">112. Path Sum</a>

Given the root of a binary tree, we're asked to return True or False if a path
exists in the binary tree where the value of the nodes sum to some targetSum. We
can use DFS to create the path, and at each node we'll keep track of the
targetSum less the values of the nodes previously visited.

If the currSum == 0 when we visit a node, we know that we've discovered a path
that sums to the targetSum and we can return True. Another contstaint is that
both the left and right nodes have to be empty.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return False

        stack = [(root, targetSum - root.val)]

        while stack:
            node, currSum = stack.pop()

            if not node.left and not node.right and currSum == 0:
                return True
            if node.right:
                stack.append((node.right, currSum - node.right.val))
            if node.left:
                stack.append((node.left, currSum - node.left.val))

        return False
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of nodes to explore.
