<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/">695. Max Area of
Island</a>

A graph connectivity question, however, we're asked to keep track of how large
each connected component is. Using UnionFind, we process the grid keeping track
of which nodes exist in the map, and setting the rank for each node to 1.

For each valid island on the map, we access its adjacent locations and determine
if they are also part of the island. If they are, these nodes are merged using
union_set. During the merge, the rank of the child node is added to the parent
node's rank - allowing us to keep track of the size of the disjoint set.

Finally, we return the max rank which is the size of the largest connected
component (island).

The solution is as follows:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        self.parent, self.rank = [0 for _ in range(n * m)], [0 for _ in range(n * m)]

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    self.parent[i * m + j] = i * m + j
                    self.rank[i * m + j] = 1

    def find(self, x: int) -> int:
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union_set(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
        xset, yset = self.find(x), self.find(y)

        if xset != yset:
            if self.rank[xset] < self.rank[yset]:
                xset, yset = yset, xset

            self.parent[yset] = xset
            self.rank[xset] += self.rank[yset]

    def get_max_size(self) -> int:
        return max(self.rank)

class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        uf = UnionFind(grid)
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    grid[i][j] = 0
                    if i - 1 > -1 and grid[i - 1][j] == 1:
                        uf.union_set(i * m + j, (i - 1) * m + j)
                    if i + 1 < n and grid[i + 1][j] == 1:
                        uf.union_set(i * m + j, (i + 1) * m + j)
                    if j - 1 > -1 and grid[i][j - 1] == 1:
                        uf.union_set(i * m + j, i * m + (j - 1))
                    if j + 1 < m and grid[i][j + 1] == 1:
                        uf.union_set(i * m + j, i * m + (j + 1))

        return uf.get_max_size()
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n^2) - We iterate through all locations on the map.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We track the parents and ranks of each node.
