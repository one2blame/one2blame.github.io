<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/">547. Number of
Provinces</a>

We're asked to determine the connectivity of a graph of cities, and return the
number of provinces. We're essentially being asked to return the number of
connected components in the graph. To do this in the fastest and coolest way
possible, we can use Union-Find. The normal way to solve this is depth-first
search - but Union-Find is way cooler.

Union-Find is a data structure that keeps track of elements which are split into
one or more disjoint sets. For each node, we check to see if they're connected.
If they are, we check to see if they're in the same disjoint set. If not, we
merge the sets and decrease our count of connected components.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n: int) -> None:
        self.parent = [i for i in range(n)] self.rank = [0 for _ in range(n)]

    def find(self, x: int) -> int:
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union_set(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
        xset, yset = self.find(x), self.find(y)

        if xset == yset:
            return
        elif self.rank[xset] < self.rank[yset]:
            self.parent[xset] = yset
        elif self.rank[yset] < self.rank[xset]:
            self.parent[yset] = xset
        else:
            self.parent[yset] = xset
            self.rank[xset] += 1

class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(isConnected)
        dsu = UnionFind(n)
        ans = n

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if isConnected[i][j] and dsu.find(i) != dsu.find(j):
                    ans -= 1
                    dsu.union_set(i, j)

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n^2) - We iterate over all values in isConnected.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain the parent and rank arrays.
