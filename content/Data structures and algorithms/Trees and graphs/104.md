104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree</a>

Pretty straight forward problem - find how deep this binary tree goes. We can
solve this with depth-first search. What is depth-first search? It's a method of
traversing a binary tree, however, instead of exploring all nodes on the same
level, we continually explore the left branch first until we reach an empty
node. Then we explore the right branch. Once those two are exhausted, we
backtrack a level and explore the right branch of the parent node.

We continue to do this in an iterative fashion using stack, maintaining the max
level we've seen so far for the binary tree.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
          ans = 0
          stack = [(1, root)]

          while stack:
              level, node = stack.pop()

              if node:
                  ans = max(ans, level)
                  stack.append((level + 1, node.right))
                  stack.append((level + 1, node.left))

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of nodes to explore.
