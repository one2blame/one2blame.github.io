<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/">226. Invert Binary
Tree</a>

We invert a binary tree. Pretty straightforward, just recursively swap the
nodes.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
          if not root:
              return root
          root.left, root.right = self.invertTree(root.right), self.invertTree(root.left)
          return root
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - Where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(h) - Where h is the height of the tree.
