2101. Detonate the Maximum Bombs</a>

Given an array of bombs, specified [x, y, r] where (x, y) is the position of the
bomb on a 2D plane and r is the blast radius, we need to determine the maximum
number of bombs we can detonate if we detonated 1 bomb. Pretty tricky but fun
problem. Intuitively, we're going to use DFS to detonate each bomb, traversing
their "edges" - bombs that are exploded by the current bomb based on blast
radius.

The biggest trick to this question is pre-processing the input to create a
graph. We create edges between the bombs by using the Python math.dist()
function to calcualte the Euclidean distance between the two bombs - if the
radius of the exploding bomb is greater than or equal to the distance between
the two bombs, we create an edge between the two bombs.

We then use DFS like we always do for every bomb in the input, maximizing the
number of bombs we can detonate.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import defaultdict from math import dist

```python
  class Solution:
      def maximumDetonation(self, bombs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
          n = len(bombs)
          graph = defaultdict(list)

          def dfs(start: int) -> int:
              seen = {start}
              stack = [start]

              while stack:
                  bomb = stack.pop()

                  for neighbor in graph[bomb]:
                      if neighbor not in seen:
                          seen.add(neighbor)
                          stack.append(neighbor)

              return len(seen)

          for i in range(n):
              for j in range(n):
                  x, y, r = bombs[i]
                  l, m, _ = bombs[j]

                  if r >= dist((x, y), (l, m)):
                      graph[i].append(j)

          ans = float("-inf")
          for k in range(n):
              ans = max(ans, dfs(k))

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n^3) - The time complexity of DFS is O(V + E), and we execute DFS O(n) times.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n^2) - We create a graph of the edges between the bombs.
