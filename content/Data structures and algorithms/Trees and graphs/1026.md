<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/">
1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor</a>

We're given the root of a binary tree and asked to find the maximum difference
between two nodes on any path in the tree starting from the root. So the path
can't be from the left side of the root to the other side of the tree - it has
to be between an ancestor and a descendant.

Given this, we can conduct depth-first search to search paths in the tree. At
each node during the search, we need to maintain the maximum value seen so far
as well as the minimum. We also update the global answer variable with max
difference between the current node and the known maximum and minimum.

After conducting this maintainence at each node, we pass the maximum and minimum
value to the left and right descendants. We continue this process until we reach
the leaves of the tree.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def __init__(self):
          self.ans = float("-inf")

      def dfs(self, node: Optional[TreeNode], maxVal: int, minVal: int) -> None:
          if not node:
              return

          self.ans = max(self.ans, abs(maxVal - node.val), abs(minVal - node.val))
          maxVal = max(maxVal, node.val)
          minVal = min(minVal, node.val)

          self.dfs(node.left, maxVal, minVal)
          self.dfs(node.right, maxVal, minVal)

      def maxAncestorDiff(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
          self.dfs(root, root.val, root.val)
          return self.ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Our call stack can grow to the size of the number of nodes in the tree.
