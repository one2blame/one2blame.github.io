<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/">101. Symmetric Tree</a>

We're asked to determine if the tree is symmetric - essentially a mirror between
the left and right subtrees starting from the root. Inuitively, we conduct
recursion to process two nodes at a time. If both nodes are None, we're
symmetric. If one of the nodes is None, we're not symmetric. Else, if the nodes
have the same value, we recursively check node1.left vs node2.right and
node2.right vs node1.left.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def is_mirror(node1: Optional[TreeNode], node2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
            if not node1 and not node2:
                return True
            if not node1 or not node2:
                return False
            return (
                node1.val == node2.val
                and is_mirror(node1.right, node2.left)
                and is_mirror(node1.left, node2.right)
            )

        return is_mirror(root, root)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - Where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(h) - Where h is the height of the tree.
