103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal</a>

We just gotta traverse a binary tree in zigzag order for each level. So the
first level is left to right, the second level is right to left, etc. We use our
regular breadth-first search approach, but we maintain the direction we're
reading with a boolean. If we're going to left to right, we append the node's
value to the tail of the list for the current level. Vice versa, we append the
node's value to the head of the list for the current level.

At each level, we append the current list to the global result. We switch the
direction boolean for the next level.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import deque

```python
  class Solution:
      def zigzagLevelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
          if not root:
              return []

          ans = []
          left_to_right = True
          queue = deque([root])

          while queue:
              curr_queue, queue = queue, deque()
              nodes = deque([])

              while curr_queue:
                  node = curr_queue.popleft()

                  if left_to_right:
                      nodes.append(node.val)
                  else:
                      nodes.appendleft(node.val)

                  if node.left:
                      queue.append(node.left)
                  if node.right:
                      queue.append(node.right)

              ans.append(nodes)
              left_to_right = not left_to_right

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain queues that can store all nodes in the binary tree.
