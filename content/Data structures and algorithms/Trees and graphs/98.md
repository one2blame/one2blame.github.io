98. Validate Binary Search Tree</a>

We're asked to validate a binary search tree. It's known that if you traverse a
binary search tree using depth-first search, if you process the elements in
order, you will access each node in sorted order. We use this property to check
if the previously visited node's value is less than the current node's value.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
          self.prev = float("-inf")

          def dfs(node: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
              if not node:
                  return True
              if not dfs(node.left):
                  return False
              if not self.prev < node.val:
                  return False
              self.prev = node.val
              return dfs(node.right)

          return dfs(root)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary search tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Our call stack can grow as large as the number of nodes in the binary
search tree.
