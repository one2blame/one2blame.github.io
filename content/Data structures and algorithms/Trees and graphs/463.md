<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/">463. Island
Perimeter</a>

Fun problem, we've got a 2D matrix with just one island. Its perimeter is
defined by the number of edges of the island that touch the water, including the
edges on the boundaries of the matrix. We can solve this by visiting each cell
and counting the number of edges that aren't land. We baseline assume that for a
given piece of land the number of edges touching the water is 4. We look in all
directions, up, right, left, and down - if they're valid directions for the
matrix and contain land we subtract by 1. We then add the number of edges for
this piece of land to our answer.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n, m, ans = len(grid), len(grid[0]), 0
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]

        def is_valid(q: int, p: int) -> bool:
            return -1 < q < n and -1 < p < m

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j]:
                    this_ans = 4

                    for dy, dx in directions:
                        ny, nx = i + dy, j + dx

                        if is_valid(ny, nx):
                            if grid[ny][nx]:
                                this_ans -= 1

                    ans += this_ans

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* m) - Where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. We
visit each cell in the matrix.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We maintain a constant amount of space for the directions list and the
variables n, m, ans.
