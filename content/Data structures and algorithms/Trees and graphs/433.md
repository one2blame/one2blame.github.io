<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/">433. Minimum
Genetic Mutation</a>

Fun question. We're asked to mutate some genes, given a starting string that
contains characters "A", "C", "G", and "T". We're asked to find the number of
steps we need to take to get to the target mutation. We're also provided with a
bank of valid mutations.

This is classic BFS problem. We start by creating a matrix of valid state
transitions for each gene character. Then we conduct our regular BFS with a
queue. If the current node is the target gene, we return the number of steps
we've taken so far. Otherwise, for each character in the current node, we check
its valid mutations (neighbors) using the matrix we created previously. If the
mutation is in the bank and not seen, we mark it as visited and add it to the
queue to process in the next step.

We continue the BFS until we find the target, otherwise we return -1.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def minMutation(self, startGene: str, endGene: str, bank: List[str]) -> int:
        mutations = {
            "A": ["C", "G", "T"],
            "C": ["G", "T", "A"],
            "G": ["T", "A", "C"],
            "T": ["A", "C", "G"],
        }

        seen = {startGene}
        queue = [(startGene, 0)]

        while queue:
            curr_queue, queue = queue, []

            for node, steps in curr_queue:
                if node == endGene:
                    return steps

                for i in range(8):
                    for c in mutations[node[i]]:
                        mutation = node[:i] + c + node[i + 1 :]

                        if mutation in bank and mutation not in seen:
                            seen.add(mutation)
                            queue.append((mutation, steps + 1))

        return -1
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(b) - Where b is the length of the bank. The BFS runs in constant time because
the length of the nodes is 8 and the number of genes is 4.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We technically use constant space.
