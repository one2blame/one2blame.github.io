1305. All Elements in Two Binary Search Trees</a>

We have the return the elements from two binary search trees in ascending order.
Little known fact about binary search trees, if you process the nodes in-order,
you can retrieve the contents in ascending order. There's two ways we can go
about this - we could process each tree separately in O(n) time, creating a list
of the elements in each tree sorted in ascending order, and the merging the two
lists. We could also process them simultaneously and iteratively.

To iteratively process the two binary trees simultaneously, we're going to have
to use stacks to emulate an in-order traversal. Just like we would do
recursively, we travel all the way down the left side of each binary search
tree, pushing the nodes onto the stack until we hit None.

Then, we compare the top nodes of the two stacks. Which ever node has the
smaller value gets popped and its value appended to the answer array. Then, like
we normally do for an in-order traversal, we process the right node of the just
popped node.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def getAllElements(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
          stack1, stack2, ans = [], [], []

          while root1 or root2 or stack1 or stack2:
              while root1:
                  _, root1 = stack1.append(root1), root1.left
              while root2:
                  _, root2 = stack2.append(root2), root2.left

              if not stack2 or stack1 and stack1[-1].val < stack2[-1].val:
                  root1 = stack1.pop()
                  _, root1 = ans.append(root1.val), root1.right
              else:
                  root2 = stack2.pop()
                  _, root2 = ans.append(root2.val), root2.right

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n + m) - Where n and m are the size of each binary search tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n + m) - We maintain the output and both stacks.
