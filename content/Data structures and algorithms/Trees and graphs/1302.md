<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/deepest-leaves-sum/">1302. Deepest Leaves
Sum</a>

We need to return the sum of the values for the deepest leaves in a binary tree.
To easily do this, we conduct a breadth-first search until we hit the level were
the deepest leaves are. We maintain two queues, one for future nodes to visit,
and one for nodes we're visiting at the current level.

We continue until no more nodes are in the future nodes queue. Once that's the
case, we know that all of the deepest leaves are the in the current level. We
sum the values of all the leaves in the current level and return the sum.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import deque

```python
  class Solution:
      def deepestLeavesSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
          queue = deque([root])

          while queue:
              curr_queue, queue = queue, deque()

              for node in curr_queue:
                  if node.left:
                      queue.append(node.left)
                  if node.right:
                      queue.append(node.right)

          return sum([node.val for node in curr_queue])
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain queues that can store all nodes in the binary tree.
