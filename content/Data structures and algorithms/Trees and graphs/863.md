863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree</a>

We're asked to return the values of the nodes that are distance k from a given
target node. We can accomplish this by conducting a DFS through the binary tree
to assign each node a parent node. This allows us to treat the binary tree as an
undirected graph.

With this updated graph, we can condcut a BFS from the target node outwards,
conducting k steps. Once we've done k steps, we return the values of the nodes
still remaining in the queue - these are the nodes at the level that are k
distance away from the target.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def distanceK(self, root: TreeNode, target: TreeNode, k: int) -> List[int]:
          stack = [(root, None)]

          while stack:
              node, parent = stack.pop()
              node.parent = parent
              if node.left:
                  stack.append((node.left, node))
              if node.right:
                  stack.append((node.right, node))

          distance = 0
          seen = {target}
          queue = [target]

          while queue and distance < k:
              curr_queue, queue = queue, []

              for node in curr_queue:
                  for neighbor in [node.left, node.right, node.parent]:
                      if neighbor and neighbor not in seen:
                          seen.add(neighbor)
                          queue.append(neighbor)

              distance += 1

          return [node.val for node in queue]
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - DFS and BFS both take O(n) time.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack, queue, and seen set that all take up O(n) space.
