<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-network-rank/">1615. Maximal
Network Rank</a>

Network rank for this graph is being calculated by taking a pair of nodes and
counting the number of edges connected to them, less the edge connected between
the two nodes. To solve this, we create an array to track the number of edges
connected to each node. We also maintain a graph to keep track of whether or not
a pair of nodes are connected.

We process each possible pair of nodes, adding their connected edges and
subtracting the edge between them - maximizing our answer across this process.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximalNetworkRank(self, n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        conns = [0] * n
        graph = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]

        for u, v in roads:
            conns[u] += 1
            conns[v] += 1
            graph[u][v] = graph[v][u] = True

        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                rank = conns[i] + conns[j]

                if graph[i][j]:
                    rank -= 1

                ans = max(ans, rank)

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(e + v^2) - Where e is the number of edges and v is the number of nodes. We
process all edges and then all possible pairs of nodes.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(e) - We maintain a graph to keep track of the connections between nodes.
