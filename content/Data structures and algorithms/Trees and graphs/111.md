111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree</a>

No point in using depht-first search for this question, we're going to end up
wasting time traveling paths that aren't the minimum. The optimal solution would
be to use breadth-first search, allowing us to travel through the binary tree
level by level, enabling us to visit less nodes.

We maintain a queue of nodes to explore, starting with root. We grab the length
of the queue at the current level and dequeue nodes until we've processed all
nodes at the current level. If we find a leaf node, a node with None for its
left and right children, we know we've reached the minimum depth. Why? Because
we're using breadth-first search, the first leaf node we encounter will always
be at the minimum level.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        queue = deque([root])
        depth = 1

        while queue:
            queue_len = len(queue)

            while queue_len > 0:
                queue_len -= 1

                node = queue.popleft()

                if not node:
                    continue

                if not node.left and not node.right:
                    return depth

                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)

            depth += 1
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of nodes to explore.
