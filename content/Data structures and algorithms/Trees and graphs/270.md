<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/">
270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value</a>

We're given a target value and asked to find the node with the value closest to
the target. We simply conduct a binary search in the binary search tree,
maintaining a closest variable that contains the value of the node closest to
the target. At each node, we update the closest variable with the value of the
node that is closest to the target using the min() function with a lambda for
comparison - this lambda being the subtraction of the target from the node
value.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def closestValue(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: float) -> int:
          closest = root.val
          while root:
              closest = min(root.val, closest, key = lambda x: (abs(target - x), x))
              root = root.left if target < root.val else root.right
          return closest
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary search tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We only maintain the closest variable.
