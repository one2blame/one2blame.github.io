<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/">543. Diameter
of Binary Tree</a>

We get the root of a binary tree and are asked to find its diameter. The
diameter is determined by the number of edges between two nodes - we're looking
for the maximum and it doesn't even have to be from the root of the tree.

We maintain a global maximum because, like stated earlier, it's not guaranteed
that the diameter of the tree passes through the root. We conduct a depth-first
search until we hit leaf nodes. Leaf nodes return 0. All other nodes sum the
results of the recursive function call from the left and right nodes and update
the global answer with the maximum.

At each node we return the maximum of the results from the left and right
function call and add 1. We add one because when we backtrack, we're
backtracking to the parent node via the edge that we account for.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
          self.ans = float("-inf")

          def dfs(node: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
              if not node:
                  return 0

              left, right = dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right)
              self.ans = max(self.ans, left + right)

              return max(left, right) + 1

          dfs(root)
          return self.ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Our call stack can grow to the size of the number of nodes in the tree.
