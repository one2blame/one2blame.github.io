<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-iii/">1306. Jump Game III</a>

We're given an array of non-negative integers and a starting location (index)
within the array. We're asked to find out if we can reach an index where the
value of arr[index] is 0. We can only move in two different ways at each index,
i + arr[i] or i - arr[i].

With this, we use BFS starting from the start index. We inspect our two
neighbors at each index, i + arr[i], i - arr[i], validating if the index is
within the bounds of the array and hasn't already been visited. If we find an
index with a value of 0, we return True. If we've exhausted all possible paths
and haven't found a 0, we return False.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def canReach(self, arr: List[int], start: int) -> bool:
          n = len(arr)
          seen = {start}
          queue = [start]

          while queue:
              curr_queue, queue = queue, []

              for i in curr_queue:
                  if arr[i] == 0:
                      return True

                  for neighbor in [i + arr[i], i - arr[i]]:
                      if neighbor not in seen and -1 < neighbor < n:
                          seen.add(neighbor)
                          queue.append(neighbor)

          return False
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - The time complexity of BFS is O(n), where n is the number of integers in
the input.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store the visited indices in a set, and the nodes to visit in a queue.
