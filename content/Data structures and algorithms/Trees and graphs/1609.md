<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/even-odd-tree/">1609. Even Odd Tree</a>

For a binary tree where levels start at 0 from the root, we're asked to
determine if the nodes at each level are of the opposite parity from the level.
So if a level is 0, all the nodes have to be odd, and vice versa.

We're also asked to make sure that on even levels, the nodes are strictly
increasing from left to right, and vice versa for odd levels, while maintain the
parity constraint mentioned above.

To solve this, we conduct a BFS and check the parity of all nodes at the current
level to make sure it satisfies the constraint. We return False as soon as that
constraint is violated. Next, we maintain the value of the last node we've seen.
If the level is odd and the node is greater than or equal to the last value, we
return False. If the level is even and the node is less than or equal to the
last value, we return False.

If none of the constraints are violated during the BFS, we return True.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def isEvenOddTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
          level = -1
          queue = [root]

          while queue:
              this_queue, queue = queue, []
              last_val = 0
              level += 1

              for node in this_queue:
                  if node.val % 2 == level % 2:
                      return False

                  if level % 2:
                      if last_val and last_val <= node.val:
                          return False
                  else:
                      if last_val and last_val >= node.val:
                          return False

                  last_val = node.val

                  if node.left:
                      queue.append(node.left)
                  if node.right:
                      queue.append(node.right)

          return True
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We traverse O(n) nodes of the tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - The queue can contain at most O(n) nodes of the tree.
