<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/">110. Balanced
Binary Tree</a>

Return True or False if the binary tree provided is height-balanced, meaning
that the difference between the heights of the two subtrees of every node never
exceeds 1.

We use DFS to visit every node in the binary tree, starting with the left node
for each recursive call. If the node we visit doesn't exist, we immediately
return 0, True. Otherwise, we recursively call the function on the left and
right nodes.

During recursion, we maximize for the depth of the left and right nodes, and we
add 1 to the maximum depth seen so far. We also return True or False if the
absolute difference of the depth between the left and right nodes is less
than 2.

During recursion, if a node encounters that a left or right subtree is not
balanced, it immediately terminates recursion by returning 0, False. This
cascades to parent nodes, causing them to also return 0, False.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
          def dfs(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> tuple:
              if not root:
                  return 0, True

              left_depth, left_balance = dfs(root.left)

              if not left_balance:
                  return 0, False

              right_depth, right_balance = dfs(root.right)

              if not right_balance:
                  return 0, False

              return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1, abs(left_depth - right_depth) < 2

          return dfs(root)[1]
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We visit every node in the binary tree during DFS.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Our recursive call stack reaches a depth of n, where n is the number of
nodes in the binary tree.
