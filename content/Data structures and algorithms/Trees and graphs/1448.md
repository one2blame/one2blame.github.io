1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree</a>

A good node in a binary tree is one whose value is greater than or equal to the
highest value seen in the current path starting from the root node. We're asked
to return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

We use depth-first search to maintain path traversal through the tree. We keep
track of the maximum value seen starting from the root node. If the current
node's value is greater than or equal to the maximum value seen in this path, we
increment the good node counter. We update the maximum value and pass this
information to the next left and right nodes in the path.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        stack = [(root, float("-inf"))]
        ans = 0

        while stack:
            node, maxVal = stack.pop()

            if maxVal <= node.val:
                ans += 1

            maxVal = max(maxVal, node.val)
            if node.right:
                stack.append((node.right, maxVal))
            if node.left:
                stack.append((node.left, maxVal))

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all nodes in the binary tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of nodes to explore.
