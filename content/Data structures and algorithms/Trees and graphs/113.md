<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/">113. Path Sum II</a>

Given the root a binary tree, we're asked to find all paths from the root to the
leaves that sum to a given targetSum. We conduct a DFS to recursively traverse
the tree, maintaining the current path as well as the paths we've found so far.
At each step of the recursion, we append the current node to the path and check
to see if the current node sums to the targetSum, and if we're also a leaf. If
so, we append the path to the paths list. Else, we subtract the current node's
value from the targetSum and continue the recursion. We pop the current node
from the path after the recursion completes.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def recurse_tree(
        self,
        node: Optional[TreeNode],
        currSum: int,
        path: List[int],
        paths_list: List[List[int]],
    ) -> None:
        if not node:
            return

        path.append(node.val)

        if currSum == node.val and not node.left and not node.right:
            paths_list.append(list(path))
        else:
            self.recurse_tree(node.left, currSum - node.val, path, paths_list)
            self.recurse_tree(node.right, currSum - node.val, path, paths_list)

        path.pop()

    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        self.recurse_tree(root, targetSum, [], res)
        return res
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n^2) - We traverse O(n) nodes of the tree, but copying over O(n) nodes from
the path to the path list causes this to be O(n^2).

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We keep track of the nodes in the path.
