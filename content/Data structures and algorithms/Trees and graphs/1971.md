1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph</a>

We're given an undirected graph with a source and destination node. We're asked
to determine if there exists a path between the two nodes in the graph. This is
a classic connectivity problem, we can solve this by using Union-Find. For each
edge, (x, y), we know each node is connected, so we execute union_set on the two
nodes to reflect that. After processing all the edges, the Union-Find data
structure will have all the nodes connected in their disjoint sets. If two nodes
are both in the same disjoint set, then a path exists between. Therefore, if our
source and destination nodes are in the same set, we return True - there is a
path between them. Otherwise, we return False.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n: int) -> None:
        self.parent, self.rank = [i for i in range(n)], [0 for _ in range(n)]

    def find(self, x: int) -> int:
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union_set(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
        xset, yset = self.find(x), self.find(y)

        if xset != yset:
            if self.rank[xset] < self.rank[yset]:
                self.parent[xset] = yset
            elif self.rank[yset] < self.rank[xset]:
                self.parent[yset] = xset
            else:
                self.parent[yset] = xset
                self.rank[xset] += 1

class Solution:
    def validPath(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], source: int, destination: int) -> bool:
        uf = UnionFind(n)

        for x, y in edges:
            uf.union_set(x, y)

        return uf.find(source) == uf.find(destination)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(m) - We iterate through the edges to perform union_set.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We track the parents and ranks of each node.
