<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/">872. Leaf-Similar
Trees</a>

Given the root of two binary trees, we're asked to determine if their leaves are
similar - meaning that they are in the same sequence, regardless of orientation
of the tree. This can be easily solved by conducting DFS on both trees,
processing the nodes in order. If we encounter a leaf, we return the value of
the leaf. Otherwise, we conduct dfs on the left node first and the right node
second. This consistent order of operations retains the order of the leaf
nodes - allowing us to determine if the two trees are leaf similar.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def leafSimilar(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
          def dfs(node: Optional[TreeNode]) -> list:
              if not node:
                  return []

              if not node.left and not node.right:
                  return [node.val]
              else:
                  return dfs(node.left) + dfs(node.right)

          return dfs(root1) == dfs(root2)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n + m) - Where n is the first tree and m is the second tree.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n + m) - Where n is the first tree and m is the second tree.
