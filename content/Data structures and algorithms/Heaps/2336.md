2336. Smallest Number in Infinite Set</a>

We're asked to create a class that will simulate that we have an infinite set of
numbers, starting at

1. The class should support the operation to pop the smallest number from the
   infinite set. Once a number is popped from the infinite set, it's considered
   to be removed from the set. The class should also support adding a number
   back into the infinite set, iff it was previously removed.

To make this happen, we use a min heap, a set, and a counter to keep track of
the numbers we can add to the heap. If the heap exists, it means numbers were
added back to the infinite set, so we pop the smallest number from the heap.
Otherwise, we return the current number and increment the counter. We also keep
track of what numbers are current removed from the set.

When a number is added back to the set, we check if it's in the removed set. If
it is, we remove it from the set and add it to the heap.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush

class SmallestInfiniteSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.h = []
        self.curr = 1
        self.out = set()

    def popSmallest(self) -> int:
        if self.h:
            res = heappop(self.h)
        else:
            res, self.curr = self.curr, self.curr + 1

        self.out.add(res)
        return res

    def addBack(self, num: int) -> None:
        if num in self.out:
            self.out.discard(num)
            heappush(self.h, num)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O((m + n)\*log(n)) - For m popSmallest operations and n addBack operations, the
heap operations take O(log(n)) time.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - The heap can store up to n elements in the worst case.
