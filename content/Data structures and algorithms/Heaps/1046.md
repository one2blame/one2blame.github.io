<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/">1046. Last Stone
Weight</a>

Given a list of stones, we're asked to smash the heaviest two stones together at
each step. If the stones weight the same, they're both destroyed. If stone x <
y, then stone y - x is left. We return the remaining stone weight or 0 if no
stones are left.

Using a heap, we can maintain the largest stones at the top of the heap. We can
then pop the two largest stones, smash them together, and push the remaining
stone back into the heap. We continue this process until there's only one stone
left.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from heapq import *

class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones = [-stone for stone in stones]
        heapify(stones)
        n = len(stones)

        while n > 1:
            y, x = -heappop(stones), -heappop(stones)
            n -= 2

            if x != y:
                n += 1
                heappush(stones, -(y - x))

        return 0 if not n else -heappop(stones)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n log n) - We conduct at most n steps, and heap operations take at most log n
time.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We store all the stones in the heap.
