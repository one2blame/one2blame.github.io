<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/">67. Add Binary</a>

Given two strings representing binary numbers, add them together and return
their sum as a binary string. This is just a fun bit manipulation problem, and
we use some native Python tricks to convert the binary numbers to integers.

Once in integer format, we use XOR to add x and y. If two bits are 1, we'll
place a 0 in that location. Simultaneously, y will store the carry after we do
AND x and y, and then we'll shift the carry bit left.

Eventually y will be empty after shifting it so much, and x will be the sum of x
and y.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def addBinary(self, a, b) -> str:
          x, y = int(a, 2), int(b, 2)
          while y:
              x, y = x ^ y, (x & y) << 1
          return bin(x)[2:]
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n + m) - Where n and m are length of the inputs strings.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(max(n, m)) - We have to convert the input strings from strings to integers.
