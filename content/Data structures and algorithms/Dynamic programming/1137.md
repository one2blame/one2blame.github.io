<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/">1137. N-th
Tribonacci Number</a>

Like Fibonacci, but with three numbers instead of two.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 3:
            return 1 if n else 0

        a, b, c = 0, 1, 1

        for _ in range(3, n + 1):
            a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c

        return c
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - Where n is the input number, we iterate n times.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We use three integers variables, taking constant space to memoize the
three numbers for the Tribonacci sequenece.
