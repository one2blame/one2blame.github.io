1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference</a>

We're asked to find the longest subsequence of numbers that all have a
difference of difference from left to right.

We solve this using dynamic programming, but not with a memoization table like
usual. Instead, we maintain dictionary of numbers seen, because, for a
subsequence, we're going to have to look backwards an arbitrary number of
spaces.

The dictionary contains, for a given number, num, the length of the subsequence
prior to reaching that number wherein all numbers have a difference of
difference. So for example, if we're looking at 2 and the difference is 2, we
the compliment would be 4. If we've seen 4 before, it will return from a
dictionary lookup, and then we append 1 to the subsequence and store dp[2].
Otherwise, the subsequence for dp[2] will be 1.

Across this process, we maximize the answer for the highest length subsequence
we've seen so far.

The solution is as follows:

from collections import defaultdict

```python
  class Solution:
      def longestSubsequence(self, arr: List[int], difference: int) -> int:
          dp = defaultdict(int)
          ans = 1

          for num in arr:
              dp[num] = dp[num - difference] + 1
              ans = max(ans, dp[num])

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - Where n is the length of arr, we iterate through the number list once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a memoization dictionary of size n.
