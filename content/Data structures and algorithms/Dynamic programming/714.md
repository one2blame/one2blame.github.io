714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee</a>

Fun dynamic programming problem, we just have to consider the states in which we
currently hold a stock and can sell, and when we don't have a stock and buy.
During the selling action, we account for the transaction fee. There are
multiple ways to solve this problem, one using recursion, another using a
memoization table, and the final one being an O(1) space solution.

The O(1) space solution, we maintain two variables, free and hold, denoting the
current state and winnings so far for those choices, with free starting on day 0
at 0 in value and hold starting on day 0 at -prices[0] in value.

We iterate through the days from 1 to n. During each day we make both choices to
update the free and hold variables, updating free to be the maximum of skipping
a buy for today, or buying the stock and updating hold to be the maximum of
skipping a sell for today, or holding the stock.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
          n = len(prices)
          free, hold = 0, -prices[0]

          for i in range(1, n):
              hold, free = max(hold, free - prices[i]), max(free, hold + prices[i] - fee)

          return free
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - Where n is the number of prices.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We store our states in constant space.
