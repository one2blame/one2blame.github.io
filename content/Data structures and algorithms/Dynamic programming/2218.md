<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-of-k-coins-from-piles/">
2218. Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles</a>

This can be solved using knapsack, but I'll show the recursive dynamic
programming solution because it's easier to understand. With dynamic
programming, we know we need to use memoization to avoid recalculating solutions
for states we've already visited. We learn that states in this problem are
defined by the current pile of coins we're visiting, and the number of coins
we've already selected.

During our recursion, we'll check to see if we've memoized the current state -
if so we return the answer. Otherwise, starting from the last pile, we keep a
current sum to track the value of the coins we've taken. We start from 0, and
take as many coins as possible from the pile or from the number of coins we're
still allowed to take.

We recursively call this function on the next pile of coins, keeping track of
the number of coins we've already selected.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxValueOfCoins(self, piles: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(piles)
        lengths = [len(pile) for pile in piles]
        memo = [[-1 for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

        def dp(i: int, c: int) -> int:
            if not i:
                return 0

            if memo[i][c] != -1:
                return memo[i][c]

            curr_sum = 0

            for curr_coins in range(0, min(lengths[i - 1], c) + 1):
                if curr_coins > 0:
                    curr_sum += piles[i - 1][curr_coins - 1]

                memo[i][c] = max(memo[i][c], curr_sum + dp(i - 1, c - curr_coins))

            return memo[i][c]

        return dp(n, k)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* k) - Where n is the number of piles and k is the number of coins we're
allowed to take.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n _ k) - Our recursive call stack can grow to a maximum of n _ k.
