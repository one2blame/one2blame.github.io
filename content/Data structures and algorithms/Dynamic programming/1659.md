<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-grid-happiness/">1659. Maximize
Grid Happiness</a>

We're given a grid of size m \* n, and a number of introverts and extroverts.
We're asked to maximize the introverts' and extroverts' happiness across the
grid. When we place an introvert, it starts out at 120 happiness, however, if
there are neighbors it loses 30 happiness per neighbor. When we place an
extrovert, it starts out at 40 happiness, and it gains 20 happiness per
neighbor.

Using top-down dynamic programming, we start at the top-left of the grid and
work our way down to the bottom-right of the grid, making three decisions
recursively at each cell. The first choice we can make is to skip placing an
introvert or an extrovert. The second choice is to place an introvert and the
third choice is to place an extrovert.

For placing an introvert and an extrovert, we calculate the total that making
this choice is going to add to the overall answer. If we place an extrovert, we
check our neighbors above and to our left. If we have neighbors, for an
introvert we lose happiness, for an extrovert we gain happiness. If our neighbor
is an introvert, that introvert also loses happiness - we account for this in
our total. If our neighbor is an extrovert, that extrovert also gains
happiness - we account for this in our total.

We choose the maximum between these choices, skipping, adding an introvert at
the current cell, or adding an extrovert at the current cell. Our recursion will
terminate with these base cases:

- Going past the last row (i == m)
- Going past the last column (j == n)
- Running out of introverts and extroverts to place

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def getMaxGridHappiness(
        self, m: int, n: int, introvertsCount: int, extrovertsCount: int
    ) -> int:
        @cache
        def dp(i: int, j: int, introverts: int, extroverts: int, prev: tuple) -> int:
            if i == m:
                return 0
            elif j == n:
                return dp(i + 1, 0, introverts, extroverts, prev)
            elif not introverts and not extroverts:
                return 0

            curr = prev[:j] + (0,) + prev[j + 1 :]
            ans = dp(i, j + 1, introverts, extroverts, curr)

            if introverts:
                total = 120

                if i and prev[j]:
                    total -= 30

                    if prev[j] == 1:
                        total -= 30
                    else:
                        total += 20

                if j and prev[j - 1]:
                    total -= 30

                    if prev[j - 1] == 1:
                        total -= 30
                    else:
                        total += 20

                curr = prev[:j] + (1,) + prev[j + 1 :]
                ans = max(ans, dp(i, j + 1, introverts - 1, extroverts, curr) + total)

            if extroverts:
                total = 40

                if i and prev[j]:
                    total += 20

                    if prev[j] == 1:
                        total -= 30
                    else:
                        total += 20

                if j and prev[j - 1]:
                    total += 20

                    if prev[j - 1] == 1:
                        total -= 30
                    else:
                        total += 20

                curr = prev[:j] + (2,) + prev[j + 1 :]
                ans = max(ans, dp(i, j + 1, introverts, extroverts - 1, curr) + total)

            return ans

        return dp(0, 0, introvertsCount, extrovertsCount, (0,) * n)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(m^2 \* n^2) - Where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(m^2 \* n^2) - Our recursive call stack can reach this size.
