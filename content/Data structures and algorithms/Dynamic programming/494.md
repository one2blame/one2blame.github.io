<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/">494. Target Sum</a>

We're given a list of numbers and we can assign them symbols, + or -. We're
asked to find all possible ways to assign these symbols that reach a target sum,
target.

Using dynamic programming, at each index, i, we can make two choices, to assign
the symbol + or - to the current number. We do this recursively until we have
assessed all numbers. If we reach the target at the end, we record this as a
valid combination and return 1, otherwise we return 0.

Once our recursion is complete, we'll have evaluated all these combos and
discovered the number of combos that sum to our target. We use the functools
@cache decorator to reuse state's we've already solved to avoid recomputing
solutions.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def findTargetSumWays(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
          n = len(nums)

          @cache
          def dp(i: int, t: int) -> int:
              if i == n:
                  if t == target:
                      return 1
                  else:
                      return 0

              return dp(i + 1, t + nums[i]) + dp(i + 1, t - nums[i])

          return dp(0, 0)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n \* t) - Where n is the length of nums and t is the target, we assess this
many different combinations.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n \* t) - This is the size of the recursion stack.
