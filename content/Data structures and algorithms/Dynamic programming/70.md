<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/">70. Climbing Stairs</a>

We're given n, the number of steps in a staircase. We're aksed to find out how
many different ways we can climb to the stop of the staircase given that we can
take 1 or 2 steps during each move.

Regular dynamic programming question. Thinking of this in terms of states, we
have two choices to make during each move, 1 step or 2 steps. And we know the
previous decisions compound into the current decision. Instead of recomputing
the number of ways we've could've reached our current state, we should just
reuse previously calculated solutions.

If n is 1 or 2, we just return each value, respectively. Otherwise, we
initialize a table of length n to memoize our answers. We set the first two
values to 1 and 2, respectively. Then, we iterate from 2 to n, calculating the
number of ways to reach the current state by adding the number of ways to reach
T[i - 1] and T[i - 2].

Once we're done, T[n - 1], the top of the staircase, will contain the number of
ways to reach the top of the staircase.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2

        T = [0] * n
        T[0] = 1
        T[1] = 2

        for i in range(2, n):
            T[i] = T[i - 1] + T[i - 2]

        return T[n - 1]
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - Where n is the input, n, we iterate from 2 to n to calculate the number
of ways to reach the top of the staircase.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a table of length n to memoize our answers.
