<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/destroying-asteroids/">2126. Destroying
Asteroids</a>

Classic example of a greedy problem. The planet absorbs asteroids with mass less
than or equal to its own mass. We have to prove if we can absorb all asteroids -
won't happen if we encounter a large asteroid first. If we sort the asteroids in
ascending order, we can just iterate through them and absorb them one by one. If
we encounter an asteroid that's too large, we can't absorb it and we return
False.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidsDestroyed(self, mass: int, asteroids: List[int]) -> bool:
        asteroids.sort()

        for asteroid in asteroids:
            if asteroid > mass:
                return False
            mass += asteroid

        return True
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n log(n)) - We have to sort the asteroids.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Python sorting uses O(n) space.
