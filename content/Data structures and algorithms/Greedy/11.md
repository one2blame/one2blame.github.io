<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/">11. Container
With Most Water</a>

We're given an array of integers, height, where height[i] represents the height
of the ith line. We need to find the maximum area of water that can be trapped
between two lines. Using a greedy approach, we'll maximize the function:

min(height[l], height[r]) \* (r - l)

where l and r are the left and right pointers, respectively. We'll walk the
pointers from the left and right towards each other, where the smaller of the
two pointers will be incremented or decremented until they cross.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = l = 0
        r = len(height) - 1

        while l < r:
            ans = max(ans, min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l))

            if height[l] > height[r]:
                r -= 1
            else:
                l += 1

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate over each height in the input.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(1) - We use constant space to store the answer and pointers.
