1196. How Many Apples Can You Put into the Basket</a>

We're given a list of weights corresponding to apples, and we're asked to pick
as many apples as possible, but our bag can fit at most 5000 units of weight for
the apples. We use the regular greedy approach, but instead of sorting the input
or using a heap, we'll use counting sort.

We determine what the max weight is, and we count the frequency of each weight
present in the input. We maintain a running total to ensure we haven't exceeded
the weight limit. From 0 to the max weight, we'll inspect our frequency
dictionary and pick as many apples as possible, ensuring we don't exceed the
weight limit.

If we can't pick any more apples, we terminate and return the number of apples
we've picked. If we can select from the current bucket of weight apples, we add
the number of apples we've picked to our answer and update our total weight.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfApples(self, weight: List[int]) -> int:
        max_weight = max(weight) + 1
        count = Counter(weight)
        ans = total = 0

        for i in range(max_weight):
            if count.get(i, 0):
                take = min(count[i], (5000 - total) // i)

                if not take:
                    break

                ans += take
                total += take * i

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n + w) - Where n is the length of the input list and w is the maximum weight
of an apple.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - Our dictionary of counts contains at most n elements.
