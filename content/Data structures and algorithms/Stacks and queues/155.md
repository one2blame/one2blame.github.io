<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/">155. Min Stack</a>

Another fun problem. We're asked to create a stack class that will support
regular stack operations, but we should also be able to provide the minimum
element in the stack in O(1) time. Intuitively, we maintain two stacks - one
regular, and one monoticically decreasing.

Whenever we push a new value onto the stack, we check to see if it's less than
the top of the monotonically decreasing stack - if so we push it to the
decreasing stack. Whenever we pop, we check to see if the current value is equal
to the top of the monotonically decreasing stack - if so we pop from the
monotonically decreasing stack.

The solution is as follows:

class MinStack: def **init**(self): self.minimum = [float("inf")] self.stack =
[]

      def push(self, val: int) -> None:
          self.stack.append(val)
          if val <= self.minimum[-1]:
              self.minimum.append(val)

      def pop(self) -> None:
          if self.stack.pop() == self.minimum[-1]:
              self.minimum.pop()

      def top(self) -> int:
          return self.stack[-1]

      def getMin(self) -> int:
          return self.minimum[-1]

```


_ Time Complexity:

  O(1) - All operations are O(1) time.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(n) - We maintain two stacks for this class.
