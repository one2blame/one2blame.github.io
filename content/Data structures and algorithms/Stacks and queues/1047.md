<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/">
1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String</a>

We're asked to remove adjacent duplicate characters from a string, and we're
asked to continue removing adjacent duplicate characters until none remain. This
could be done doing multiple passes through the string, but that's not super
efficient.

Using a stack allows us to intuitively track the last time we've seen a
character. If we encounter a duplicate character and it matches the character on
the top of the stack, we know that this character is an adjacent duplicate and
we can pop it off the stack.

Once we've omitted all adjacent duplicates, we can join the stack and return the
result.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str) -> str:
        if not s: return s

        res = []
        for c in s:
            if not res or res[-1] != c:
                res.append(c)
            else:
                res.pop()

        return "".join(res)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all characters within the string.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of only unique characters.
