<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/">20. Valid
Parentheses</a>

This problem just requires us to validate that parentheses and brackets, etc.
are opened and closed correctly in the given string. We accomplish this by using
a stack to keep track of the most recently seen opening character. If we see a
closing character, we pop the opening character off the stack and verify a
match.

If the closing bracket and the opening bracket from the stack don't match -
we've got a problem. Otherwise, we continue to process the string until the end,
returning True. If characters still remain in the stack, we know that we didn't
see a matching closing bracket - another problem. In this case, we return False.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        pairs = dict([("(", ")"), ("{", "}"), ("[", "]")])
        stack = []

        for bracket in s:
            if bracket in pairs:
                stack.append(bracket)
            else:
                if stack:
                    opening_bracket = stack.pop()
                else:
                    return False

                if pairs[opening_bracket] != bracket:
                    return False

        if stack:
            return False

        return True
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all characters within the string.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of opening brackets.
