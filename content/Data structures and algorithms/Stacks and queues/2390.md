<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string/">
2390. Removing Stars from a String</a>

This problem is similar to <a href="844.html">844. Backspace String Compare</a>.
We're given a string and asked to remove all asterisks and adjacent characters.
We return the string after all asterisks are removed.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        ans = []

        for c in s:
            if c == '*' and ans:
                ans.pop()
            else:
                ans.append(c)

        return "".join(ans)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all characters in the string.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack to create the result.
