<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/">946. Validate
Stack Sequences</a>

We're given to lists, pushed and popped, and we're asked to verify if these
operations could've been conducted on a real stack - if the operations conform
to true stack operations. It's helpful that the elements in the pushed list are
unique - the popped list is a permutation of the pushed list.

Given this, we just simulate stack operations with the pushed and popped stack,
verifying that number of pop operations coincides with the number of elements in
the popped list. We maintain a counter, i, that we use to count the number of
pop operations as well as index into the popped list so we can keep track of the
next number we expect to pop.

We pop items off the list when the top of the pushed stack is equal to the
current element we expect to be popped.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def validateStackSequences(self, pushed: List[int], popped: List[int]) -> bool:
        i = 0
        stack = []

        for push in pushed:
            stack.append(push)

            while stack and stack[-1] == popped[i]:
                stack.pop()
                i += 1

        return i == len(popped)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all elements in the pushed list once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack to create the result.
