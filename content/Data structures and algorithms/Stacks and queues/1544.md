<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/make-the-string-great/">1544. Make the
String Great</a>

Omit duplicates in a string where the duplicates are adjacent and they differ by
case - lower and upper. Inuitively solved with a stack to maintain the last seen
character. If the stack contains characters, compare the top of the stack with
the current character, using an XOR trick to calculate the difference. If the
difference is 32, pop the stack. Otherwise, append the character to the stack.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []

        for c in s:
            if stack and ord(c) ^ ord(stack[-1]) == 32:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(c)


        return "".join(stack)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all characters within the string.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of only unique characters.
