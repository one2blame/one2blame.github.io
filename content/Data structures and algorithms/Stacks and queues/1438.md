<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/">
1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit</a>

We're asked to calculate the length of the longest subarray with an absolute
difference between the subarray's maximum and minimum elements.

From a previous problem, <a href="239.html">239</a>, we know that we can use a
monotonic queue to maintain the maximum across a subarray and remove the
elements from the left side of the queue once we exit a particular sliding
window. Now we just do that for a minimum monotonic queue as well, and our
deciding factor to shrink the window will be if the difference between the
maximum and the minimum is greater than the limit.

In our solution, we maintain the queues in the beginning, and then add the most
recent element. We calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum
elements in the current subarray. If the difference is too great, if the
leftmost element in each monotonic queue is the same as the leftmost element in
the sliding window, we pop it from each queue and shrink the window.

Finally, we calculate the answer by maintaining the maximum length of the window
seen so far.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        increasing = deque()
        decreasing = deque()
        left = ans = 0

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            while increasing and increasing[-1] > nums[right]:
                increasing.pop()
            while decreasing and decreasing[-1] < nums[right]:
                decreasing.pop()

            increasing.append(nums[right])
            decreasing.append(nums[right])

            while decreasing[0] - increasing[0] > limit:
                if nums[left] == decreasing[0]:
                    decreasing.popleft()
                if nums[left] == increasing[0]:
                    increasing.popleft()
                left += 1

            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all values in the input array.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain two monotonic queues.
