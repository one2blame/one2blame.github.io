<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/">844. Backspace
String Compare</a>

We're checking to see if two strings are equal after we resolve the backspace
character, #. This backspace character removes the preceeding character from the
string. The simplest way to solve this is to maintain a stack of characters
we've seen. If the backspace character appears, we pop the most recently seen
character from the stack - if the stack is not empty.

Finally, we join both stack and return the result.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
          def resolve(r: str) -> str:
              string = []

              for c in r:
                  if c == "#":
                      if string: string.pop()
                  else: string.append(c)

              return "".join(string)

          return resolve(s) == resolve(t)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We inspect all characters within the string.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of characters we've seen.
