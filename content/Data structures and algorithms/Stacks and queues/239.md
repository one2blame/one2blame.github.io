<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/">239. Sliding
Window Maximum</a>

This is a Hard problem, and I can see why. We're given an integer array and
asked to return another array of the maximum value encountered in each sliding
window of size k. The best way to solve this involves a monotonic stack wherein
we maintain the indices of the maximum values found within each sliding window.

Before adding a value to the stack, we pop off any values that are less than the
current value. This maintains the maximization nature of our monotonic stack. We
add the index of the new value to the stack.

We check to see if the sum of the window size, k, and the index of the greatest
element, at the end of the stack, is equal to the current index. This tells us
that the window has grown too large, past k, therefore we pop the leftmost index
off the stack.

Finally, if the size of the window is greater than or equal to k, we add the
value at the leftmost index, the maximal value of this current sliding window,
to the answer array.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        ans = []
        queue = deque()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            while queue and nums[i] > nums[queue[-1]]:
                queue.pop()

            queue.append(i)

            if queue[0] + k == i:
                queue.popleft()

            if i >= k - 1:
                ans.append(nums[queue[0]])

        return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We process all integers in the input list once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(k) - We store at most k values in the monotonic stack.
