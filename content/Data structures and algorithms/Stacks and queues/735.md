<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/">735. Asteroid
Collision</a>

Fun problem. Given some asteroids, their sign tells what direction they're
going. If the signs don't match, and one asteroid is bigger than the other, the
smaller one explodes - vice versa. If they're the same size, different
direction, they both explode.

We have to return the number of remaining asteroids after all collisions are
resolved. We can solve this using a stack - kinda monotonically. We essentially
keep processing the asteroids with different signs at the top of the stack vs
the current asteroid until one of the explodes. We do some calculations to find
out which one remains.

The solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        n = 0

        for asteroid in asteroids:
            stack.append(asteroid)
            n += 1

            while n > 1 and stack[-1] < 0 and stack[-2] > 0:
                x, y = stack.pop(), stack.pop()

                if abs(y) < abs(x):
                    stack.append(x)
                    n += 1
                elif abs(y) > abs(x):
                    stack.append(y)
                    n += 1

                n -= 2

        return stack
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We process all asteroids once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain a stack of remaining asteroids post-collision.
