346. Moving Average from Data Stream</a>

An interesting problem because we're maintaining the average of a sliding window
from a data stream, we're not given the values wholesale in one input. We're
given the size of the sliding window to maintain the moving average within. When
the class's .next method is called, we're provided with an integer to update the
sliding window. This will cause the moving average to update as well, however,
we need to maintain the size of the sliding window.

We solve this by maintaining the sliding window in a queue. If the queue reaches
capacity, we pop off in FIFO order the oldest value of the sliding window. We
subtract the popped value from the running sum while also adding the new value,
updating the running sum.

Finally, we return the running sum divided by the length of the queue to get the
moving average.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import deque

class MovingAverage:
    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.size = size
        self.queue = deque()
        self.window_sum = self.count = 0

    def next(self, val: int) -> float:
        self.count += 1
        self.queue.append(val)
        tail = self.queue.popleft() if self.count > self.size else 0
        self.window_sum = self.window_sum - tail + val
        return self.window_sum / min(self.size, self.count)
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(1) - Popping from the queue and calculating the moving average happens in
constant time.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - The sliding window is size n.
