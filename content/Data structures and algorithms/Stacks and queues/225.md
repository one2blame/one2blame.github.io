225. Implement Stack using Queues</a>

Another fun problem requiring us to implement methods in a class. This time,
instead of implementing a queue using stacks, like <a href="232.html">232.
Implement Queue using Stacks</a>, we are asked to implement a stack using
queues. Surprise here, we're only going to need one queue for the optimal
solution.

A stack always return the most recently pushed element. A queue returns the
element that was pushed first. In a queue, our elements can only enter from the
back and exit from the front. So, in order to emulate the behavior of a stack,
we're going to have to get the most recently entered element from the back to
the front.

We do this by rotating the queue, dequeuing the elements from the front and
enqueuing to the back, except for the most recently enqueued element.
Eventually, the most recenelty enqueued element will be in the front, and we
will not be emulating a stack.

What's also pretty is, if we do this every time a push operation occurs, we
essentially emulate a stack with a queue.

The solution is as follows:

```python
from collections import deque

class MyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = deque([])

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.queue.append(x)
        for _ in range(len(self.queue) - 1):
            self.queue.append(self.queue.popleft())

    def pop(self) -> int:
        return self.queue.popleft()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.queue[0]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not self.queue
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We have to process all the elements of the queue every time a push
operation occurs.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain one queue to emulate a stack.
