<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/">901. Online Stock
Span</a>

Daily stock prices are streamed to us, and we need to calculate the span of the
stock price for each day. What's a span? It's the number of consecutive days
before the current day that have a stock price less than or equal to the current
day's price.

This is a fun problem that requires us to stare at the numbers for a bit. What
we realize is that we need to maintain a monotonically decreasing stack. As we
encounter a new price, we pop off all prices that are less than or equal to the
current price. We also maintain each day's span in the monotonically decreasing
stack, allowing us to calculate the span for the current day - by nature of the
monotonically decreasing stack.

If we don't pop anything off of the monotonically decreasing stack, we know that
the current day's span is 1. After processing the stack, we append the current
day with its span.

Finally, we join both stack and return the result.

The solution is as follows:

class StockSpanner:

      def __init__(self):
          self.stack = []

      def next(self, price: int) -> int:
          res = 1

          while self.stack and price >= self.stack[-1][0]:
              res += self.stack.pop()[1]

          self.stack.append([price, res])
          return self.stack[-1][1]

```


_ Time Complexity:

  O(1) - Analysis of the monotonically increasing stack is O(1) per call to next.

_ Space Complexity:

  O(n) - In the worst case scenario, we have to store all n prices in the stack.
