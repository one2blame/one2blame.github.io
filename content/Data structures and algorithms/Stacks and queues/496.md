<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/">496. Next
Greater Element I</a>

We have two arrays, the first one is a subset of the second one. We need to
return a list that correlates to the first list, containing the value of the
next greater element for the value in the second list - these indices correlate
from the first list to the answer list.

To solve this, we create a dictionary mapping the numbers in the first list to
their indices. This way we can easily recreate the answer list with the indices
from the first list. Next, we iterate through each value in the list and
maintain a decreasing monotonic stack. If the current element we're inspecting
is greater than the items in the stack, we pop them off, accessing their indices
from the mapping to correlate to the first list and the answer list, updating
the answer list with the value of the number from the second list.

After cleaning up the monotonic stack, we add the current value to the stack. We
continue this until all values in the second array are processed.

The solution is as follows:

```python
  class Solution:
      def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
          n = len(nums1)
          mapping = {}
          ans = [-1] * n

          for i in range(n):
              mapping[nums1[i]] = i

          stack = []
          for j in range(len(nums2)):
              while stack and stack[-1] < nums2[j]:
                  lesser = stack.pop()
                  if lesser in mapping:
                      ans[mapping[lesser]] = nums2[j]

              stack.append(nums2[j])

          return ans
```

\_ Time Complexity:

O(n) - We iterate through each list once.

\_ Space Complexity:

O(n) - We maintain the indices from the first list for each value in a
dictionary.
