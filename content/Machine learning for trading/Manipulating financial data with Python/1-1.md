This lesson contains a basic introduction to the manipulation of data using Python. Most of the data
provided in this course comes in the format of `.csv` files.

## What does real stock data look like?

Usually, each `.csv` file containing stock data is named after its respective stock symbol. We can
expect the following headers in the stock's `.csv` file:

- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume
- Adjusted Close (Adj Close)

Each `.csv` file is sorted from newest to oldest record, based upon the `Date` field.

## The pandas dataframe

`pandas` is a Python library used to manipulate large sets of data. When `pandas` ingests `.csv`, it
stores the rows and columns in a certain format, or dataframe, that allows us to easily access
different sets of data programmatically. Below is an example drawing from the class of the Pandas
dataframe, each plane of the dataframe is separated by the headers we listed above: **Close**,
**Volume**, **Adj Close**, etc.
