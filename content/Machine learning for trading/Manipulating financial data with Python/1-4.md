## Global statistics

We can easily compute global statistics like **mean**, **median**, **standard deviation**, and more
using `pandas` dataframes. A high-level interpretation provided in the course lecture is provided
below:

## Rolling statistics

**Rolling statistics** are statistics observed during a time-slice of the global data. These
**rolling statistics** allow us to derive trends from the global data. A high-level interpretation
provided in the course lecture is provided below:

## Bollinger bands

**Bollinger bands** are a trading concept where we maintain a **rolling mean** and define two bands
that are separated **two standard deviations** from the rolling mean in both directions. Once a
stock's value crosses below the lower threshold and then crosses above it, we can consider this a
**buy signal**. Similarly, we can detect a **sell** signal when a stock crosses above the higher
threshold and begins to dip below it. A high-level interpretation provided in the course lecture is
provided below:

## Daily returns

**Daily returns** can be easily calculated using the following equation:

- `daily_ret(t) = (price[t] / price[t-1]) - 1`

Where `t == date`.

A high-level representation of daily returns from the course lecture is provided below:

## Cumulative returns

**Cumulative returns** can be easily calculated using the following equation:

- `cumulative_ret(t) = (price[t] / price[0]) - 1`

A high-level representation of cumulative returns from the course lecture is provided below:
