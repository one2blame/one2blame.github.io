This lesson covers more in-depth manipulation of stock data in `.csv` files with `pandas`. In this
lesson, we create empty `dataframes` with `pandas` and selectively include data from a number of
`.csv` files of different stock symbols. This lesson provides examples of selecting stock
information based upon date ranges from various stock symbols, and provides guidance on how to avoid
ingesting invalid (`NaN` values) into the dataframe. An example provided by the lesson can be found
[here](1-2_WorkingWithMultipleStocks.py).

## Inner join vs outer join

An **inner join** of a table provides the common items between the two tables being joined. An
example Venn-diagram of the operation is provided below:

An **outer join** of a table provides the common items between two tables, as well, however it also
provides the left or right quantities of the two tables being joined. An example Venn-diagram of a
**left outer join** and a **right outer join** are provided below:

![right-outer-join](right-outer-join.png)

### The default method of `join` for a `pandas` dataframe is the left outer join.

## Normalizing price data

The preferred method to normalize data within a `pandas` dataframe is to conduct the following
operation in Python:

```python
my_dataframe = my_dataframe / mydataframe.ix[0, :]
```
