## Two stock scenario

In this scenario, we've used some machine learning model to predict that a particular stock, **A**,
will be +1% over the market and stock **B** will be -1% below the market. Given this, we take a long
and short position to make a profit. A high-level overview from the lectures on how to calculate
these returns using **beta** under these circumstances is provided below:

## Two stock takeaways

The below snippet from the lecture reinforces that, if we're not careful with how we allocate our
money, we could end up losing money taking **short** positions in an upward trending market, and
**losing** money taking **long** positions in a downward trending market. Basically, you need to
hold the right stocks with the right **beta** for the right market.

## Two stock CAPM math

The lecture takes the examples provided earlier and uses **CAPM** to simplify the math into a
regression equation. The point of this lecture is to state that we can remove market influence on
our portfolio if we aim to minimize **beta** to 0.

## Allocations to remove risk

The lecture covers how to calculate allocations, `W[i]`, to remove risk from a portfolio.

## Wrapping up

The lecture covers how to calculate returns when the market has a **10%** increase, given the
allocations we calculated previously to remove market influence on the portfolio.
