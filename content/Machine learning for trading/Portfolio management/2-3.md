## Why company value matters

A company has a **true** value and a **stock price**. The true value is not always readily apparent,
and the stock value goes high or low over time, depending on trends in the market. Like always, when
a stock is overvalued we want to **sell** and when a stock is undervalued, we want to **buy**.

- **Intrinsic value** - the value of a company as estimated by future dividends
- **Book value** - assets that the company owns
- **Market cap** - value of the stock on the market

Below is a high-level overview from the lecture of the concepts above:

## The value of a future dollar

This section of the lecture discusses the value of a future dollar - how we can calculate how much a
dollar will be worth given a particular interest rate on a bond.

The equation is as follows:

- `price_value = future_value / (1 + interest_rate)**years`

Obviously, a dollar now is worth more than a dollar in the future. The high-level representation
below displays how to calculate price value against future value given an interest rate.

## Intrinsic value

The lecture provides a breakdown on how to calculate intrinsic value, given a particular **interest
rate** or **discount rate**. The equation is essentially as follows:

- `intrinsic_value = future_value / discount_rate`

## Market capitalization

**Market capitalization** or **market cap** is simple:

- `market_cap = num_shares * share_price`
