## Definition of a portfolio

Before we begin talking about **CAPM**, the lecture first defines what constitutes a portfolio. This
definition is important to effectively understand the **CAPM** equation.

## Calculating portfolio return

Below is an exercise from the lecture on calculating portfolio returns:

## Market portfolio

The lecture provides a breakdown on what comprises a **market portfolio**. In this case, the
discussion revolves around the **SP500**, comprised of the top 500 stocks in the U.S. with the
highest market caps. Each stock within the portfolio is cap weighted with the following equation:

- `weight = market_cap[i] / sum(market_caps)`

## The CAPM equation

The **CAPM** equation is a regression equation represented as follows:

- `returns[i] = (beta[i] * market_return) + alpha[i]`

A definition for each variable in the **CAPM** equation is as follows:

- `returns[i]` - returns for a particular stock on a particular day
- `beta[i]` - the extent in which the market affects stock `i`
- `market_return` - the market's return for a particular day
- `alpha[i]` - residual returns unaffected by the market. The expected value `E` of this variable is
  `0`.

## CAPM vs active management

This section of the lecture defines portfolio management strategies, **passive** and **active**.
**Passive** portfolio management involves buying an index and holding. **Passive** portfolio
management also assumes that **alpha** is random, unpredictable, and will always be an expected
value of 0. **Active** managers of portfolios believe they can predict **alpha**.

## Calculating CAPM for portfolios

This section of the lectures provides us with equations to calculate the returns for an entire
portfolio using **CAPM**. With **CAPM** and **passive** management , we can effectively assume that
**alpha** is 0 and then we can calculate **beta** across all assets to arrive at a **portfolio
beta**.

**Active** management strategies don't assume that **alpha** is 0 and will proceed to sum the
**alpha** for all assets in the portfolio.
