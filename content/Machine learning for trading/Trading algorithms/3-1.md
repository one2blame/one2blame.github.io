## The ML problem

Plenty of hedge funds leverage machine learning models and just plain models to make predictions
about the market using observation. And this essentially what a **model** does, machine learning or
not. Provided some **observation**, a **model** produces some **prediction**.

In this course, we'll cover how we can process large amounts of **data**, provide it to a **machine
learning algorithm** to produce a **model**, and use that **model** to make **predictions** from
provided **observations**.

## Choosing X and Y

Some examples provided by the course lecture to classify **observations** and **predications** are
as follows:

- observations
  - price momentum
  - Bollinger value
  - current price
- predictions
  - future price
  - future return

## Supervised regression learning

What's the definition of **supervised regression learning**? **Supervised** means we provided an
example **observation** and **prediction**. **Regression** means the model will be producing some
**numerical prediction**. **Learning** means we train the model with some data. There are multiple
algorithms to conduct **supervised regression learning**:

- Linear regression (parametric)
  - Leverage data to create parameters and then discards the data
- K nearest neighbor (KNN) (instance based)
  - Retains historic data and consults the data
- Decision trees
- Decision forests

## Backtesting

**Backtesting** is a technique wherein we utilize historical data with our machine learning
algorithm and subsequent model to make predictions on events that have already happened. Using the
results of our forecasting, we can make determinations as to how accurate our model is and how
confident we can be in its predictions. Below is a slide from the lectures on this:
