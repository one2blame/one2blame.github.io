title: Knowledge is power
---

Welcome to my mind. No, seriously, I'm trying to create a digital representation of my mind. We live
pretty long lives, and during our lives we learn a lot of things - but we also forget a lot of
things, too.

This is my attempt at remembering the thing's I've learned, to categorize them, relate them - make
connections. I doubt any of the things I've learned and documented here are unique. Regardless, I
hope you find something useful in these notes.

Welcome, stranger! And happy hunting.
